## Before you begin

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Sign up for Lindy" icon="user-plus">
    Create your free account at [app.lindy.ai]([PLACEHOLDER_SIGNUP_URL])
  </Card>
  <Card title="Connect Gmail" icon="envelope">
    You'll connect your email during setup (takes 30 seconds)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 1: Create your first agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Lindy">
    Go to [app.lindy.ai]([PLACEHOLDER_APP_URL]) and click **"Create Agent"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a template">
    Select **"Email Assistant"** from the templates
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/template-selection.png" alt="Template Selection" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your agent">
    Give it a memorable name like "Email Helper" or keep the default
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Can't find the template? You can also start from scratch and follow along!
</Tip>

## Step 2: Set up the trigger

Your agent needs to know when to act. Let's set it up to trigger when you receive emails.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Using the template">
    The email trigger is pre-configured! Just click **"Connect Gmail"** when prompted.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Starting from scratch">
    1. Click **"Add Trigger"**
    2. Choose **"Email Received"**
    3. Connect your Gmail account
    4. Set filter to "Unread emails in Inbox"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Frame caption="Your trigger should look like this">
  <img src="/images/email-trigger-setup.png" alt="Email Trigger Setup" />
</Frame>

## Step 3: Configure the AI response

Now let's tell Lindy how to draft responses.

<CodeGroup>
```text Prompt Template
You are an AI email assistant. Draft a professional response to the email below.

Guidelines:
- Be friendly but professional
- Keep responses concise (under 150 words)
- If it's a question, provide a helpful answer
- If it's a request, acknowledge it and provide next steps
- Always end with a polite closing

Email to respond to:
{{email.body}}

From: {{email.sender}}
Subject: {{email.subject}}
```

```text Example Output
Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out about the project timeline. I'd be happy to discuss this further.

Based on our current progress, we're on track to complete Phase 1 by Friday. Phase 2 will likely take an additional week, putting us at completion around the 15th.

Would you like to schedule a quick call tomorrow to go over the details? I'm available between 2-4 PM.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 4: Test your agent

Time to see your agent in action!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send a test email">
    Send an email to yourself with subject "Test for Lindy"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">
    Click **"Test Agent"** in Lindy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the draft">
    Check the drafted response in the activity log
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Not working? Common fixes">
  - Make sure Gmail is properly connected
  - Check that you have unread emails in your inbox
  - Verify the trigger conditions match your test email
  - Look at the activity log for any error messages
</Accordion>

## Step 5: Activate and customize

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Turn it on" icon="power-off">
    Toggle the agent to **"Active"** to run automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add conditions" icon="filter">
    Set rules for which emails to respond to
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customize responses" icon="palette">
    Adjust the prompt to match your writing style
  </Card>
  <Card title="Add actions" icon="plus">
    Have Lindy create drafts, send emails, or update your CRM
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
