## What is a Lindy?

Lindy is a no-code platform that allows you to build your own AI agents to automate business workflows.

Triggered by specific events, Lindy's AI agents connect your favorite apps and communicate with you through almost any platform to complete tasks.

AI agents can respond to emails, schedule meetings, assist with sales, take meeting notes, handle data entry, and provide customer support, helping you automate entire business workflows.

## Building Your First Lindy

Welcome to Lindy! 

In this guide, you'll learn how to build your first AI email assistant. This will take less than five minutes, and after you're done, you'll have an email responder (because no one loves to answer emails themselves).

Let's get started!

## Step 1: Create a New Lindy

Click the "New Lindy" button below Home in the top left of your workspace to begin building your AI agent.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/create_new_lindy.avif" 
    alt="Create a new Lindy" 
  />
</Frame>

Click "Start from scratch" to create a new AI agent.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/start_from_scratch.avif" 
    alt="Start from scratch option" 
  />
</Frame>

## Step 2: Add a Trigger

<Info>
**What are triggers?**

[Triggers](/core-concepts/triggers) are events that "wake up" an AI agent. Examples include time-based triggers (e.g., every weekday at 9 am) or event-based triggers (e.g., when you receive an email).

A single AI agent can have multiple triggers, either managing different workflows, or acting as entry points into the same workflow.
</Info>

You can apply filters to your triggers to reduce costs and ensure all workflows are initiated by desired events. [Learn more about using Filters](/core-concepts/conditions).

### Setting up the Email Trigger

1. Click **"Select Trigger"**
2. Click **Gmail** 
3. Add the **Email Received** trigger

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/select_trigger.avif" 
    alt="Select trigger interface" 
  />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/gmail_select_trigger.avif" 
    alt="Gmail trigger selection" 
  />
</Frame>

Connect the Gmail account you want your AI agent to monitor.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/connect_gmail.avif" 
    alt="Connect Gmail account" 
  />
</Frame>

## Step 3: Add a Condition

<Info>
**What are conditions?**

[Conditions](/core-concepts/conditions) let you define different paths in your automation based on specific criteria. They help your AI agent make smart decisions about which emails to respond to.
</Info>

Now that your AI agent wakes up with every email, let's set a condition to define which emails deserve a response.

Click the "Condition" step under "Perform an action" and "Search knowledge base."

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/conditions.avif" 
    alt="Add condition step" 
  />
</Frame>

### Configure Your Condition

Lindy will only proceed to the next step if the condition is met. Each condition begins with "Go down this path if..."

Set your condition prompt to:

```text
the emailer is asking a question about my service, product, or company
```

With this prompt, your AI agent will only continue if it receives relevant business inquiries.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/conditions_prompt.avif" 
    alt="Condition prompt configuration" 
  />
</Frame>

## Step 4: Add a Knowledge Base

<Info>
**What is a knowledge base?**

The [knowledge base](/core-concepts/knowledge-base) is a repository of data from which your AI agent retrieves information. AI agents search through knowledge bases semantically, finding results whose meaning is similar, even if the exact text doesn't match.

For example, searching for "refunds" will also find entries related to "returns."
</Info>

Now we'll give your AI agent knowledge about your business so it knows how to respond accurately.

Click "Add step" and select "Search knowledge base."

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/knowledge_base.avif" 
    alt="Add knowledge base step" 
  />
</Frame>

Click "Website" to add your company website as a knowledge source.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/select_knowledge_base.png" 
    alt="Select knowledge base type" 
  />
</Frame>

Insert your personal or company website URL and click "crawl" to index all pages linked from your site. You'll have the option to remove specific pages later if needed.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/website_add_to_knowledge_base.avif" 
    alt="Add website to knowledge base" 
  />
</Frame>

## Step 5: Add an Action

<Info>
**What are actions?**

[Actions](/core-concepts/actions) are tasks your AI agent performs, such as replying to emails, updating a HubSpot CRM, or creating a Notion page.
</Info>

Your AI agent now receives emails and searches your website for relevant information. The final step is configuring how it responds.

Click "Add step" (the blue plus sign beneath the Knowledge Base) and select "Perform an action."

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/perform_action.avif" 
    alt="Add action step" 
  />
</Frame>

Click the Gmail action in the "Recommended" section to ensure your AI agent responds in the same email thread.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/add_gmail_action.avif" 
    alt="Select Gmail action" 
  />
</Frame>

Select "Gmail Send Reply" to configure your response action.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/gmail_send_reply.avif" 
    alt="Gmail send reply action" 
  />
</Frame>

### Configure Your Response

Now customize how your AI agent crafts responses using your knowledge base.

1. Ensure the **Body** field is set to **"Prompt AI"**
2. Add this prompt to instruct your AI agent:

```text
You are a competent email responder that will use context from a knowledge base 
to succinctly respond to emailers' questions about my service, product, or company. 
ONLY respond with exact information extracted from the knowledge base and keep 
emails friendly and informative. Never more than 3 sentences.
```

The "Reply To" field defaults to "All," ensuring your AI agent responds to the sender and anyone else included in the email thread.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/gmail_send_reply_prompt_usage.avif" 
    alt="Gmail reply configuration" 
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** BCC yourself on responses to monitor your AI agent's performance.

Set the BCC field to "Set Manually" and enter your email address. This gives you visibility into all responses without cluttering the recipient's inbox.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/bcc_email_for_agent_responses.avif" 
    alt="BCC configuration" 
  />
</Frame>
</Tip>

## Step 6: Test Your Agent

Time to see your AI agent in action!

1. Click the "Save" button to save your workflow

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/save_flow_email.avif" 
    alt="Save your workflow" 
  />
</Frame>

2. Send yourself a test email from a different address (personal email works great) with a question about your business

3. Click "Test Mode" and select your test email

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/test_flow_email.avif" 
    alt="Test mode interface" 
  />
</Frame>

4. Watch as your AI agent processes the email and generates a response

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/condition_path_agent_takes_email.avif" 
    alt="Test results showing condition path" 
  />
</Frame>

## Step 7: Name and Monitor Your Agent

Give your AI agent a memorable name that reflects its purpose.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/rename_your_lindy_email.avif" 
    alt="Rename your agent" 
  />
</Frame>

Once enabled, click "Tasks" to view your AI agent's activity history and monitor its performance.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/lindy-brand-assets/view_task_history_email.avif" 
    alt="View task history" 
  />
</Frame>
