## What is Lindy?

Lindy is the simplest way to create AI agents — smart automations that integrate with all your apps, from Gmail to HubSpot, to save you hours a week and help you grow your business.
Unlike traditional automation tools that require complex workflows, Lindy's AI agents think and adapt. They can respond to emails with context, schedule meetings based on your preferences, qualify leads, take detailed meeting notes, handle data entry, and provide personalized customer support. Each agent connects seamlessly with your existing tools and communicates through the platforms you already use.

## The problem with repetitive work

Every day, knowledge workers spend 40% of their time on repetitive tasks. Email responses, data entry, meeting notes, customer support tickets - the list goes on. These tasks are necessary but not strategic. They're perfect for automation.

## Enter Lindy: Your AI workforce

Lindy transforms how you handle repetitive work by providing AI agents that don't just follow rules — they understand context and make intelligent decisions. With no coding required, you can build a team of specialized AI assistants that work around the clock, freeing you to focus on what truly matters for growing your business.

## How Lindy is different

### No-code, truly
Other automation tools still feel like programming. Lindy uses simple drag-and-drop workflows that anyone can build. No technical knowledge required.

### Minutes to value
Most automation tools take weeks to set up. With Lindy, you can build and deploy your first AI agent in minutes.

### Actually intelligent
Traditional automation breaks when something unexpected happens. Lindy's AI agents understand context and adapt to new situations, just like a human assistant would.

### Works with everything
Lindy connects to 3,000+ apps right out of the box. Your agents work across your entire tech stack — from Gmail to HubSpot to your CRM.
