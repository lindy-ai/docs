## What is Lindy?

Lindy is a no-code platform that allows you to build your own AI agents to automate business workflows.

Triggered by specific events, Lindy's AI agents connect your favorite apps and communicate with you through almost any platform to complete tasks. AI agents can respond to emails, schedule meetings, assist with sales, take meeting notes, handle data entry, and provide customer support, helping you automate entire business workflows.

## The problem with repetitive work

Every day, knowledge workers spend 40% of their time on repetitive tasks. Email responses, data entry, meeting notes, customer support tickets - the list goes on. These tasks are necessary but not strategic. They're perfect for automation.

## Enter Lindy: Your AI workforce

Lindy is an AI agent platform that lets you build intelligent automations without writing a single line of code. Think of Lindy as your team of AI assistants, each specialized in different tasks, working 24/7 to handle your repetitive work.

## How Lindy is different

### ðŸŽ¯ No-code, truly

Unlike other "no-code" tools that still require technical knowledge, Lindy is designed for everyone. If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can build it.

### âš¡ Minutes to value

Most automation tools take weeks to implement. With Lindy, you'll have your first agent running in under 5 minutes.

### ðŸ§  Actually intelligent

Lindy uses cutting-edge AI to understand context, make decisions, and handle edge cases - just like a human assistant would.
