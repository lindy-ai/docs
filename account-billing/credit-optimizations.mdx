## Overview

We want to make using Lindy as efficient and affordable as possible. This guide explains how to cut costs while maintaining automation quality. Perfect for:

- **Cost reduction** — significantly lower credit consumption without sacrificing performance
- **Smart filtering** — only run automations when they're actually needed
- **Model optimization** — choose the right balance of capability and cost

Many expensive operations happen because your agent manages memory and context throughout workflows. Using strategic memory management can dramatically reduce costs while keeping what matters.

## How to Cut Costs

### 1. Filter High-Volume Triggers

One of the most effective ways to save money is by filtering frequently occurring triggers, such as new incoming emails. Not every email or event needs to trigger an agent action.

- **Example**: If you work at Acme and want your agent to label emails from your team with "Acme", apply a filter to only trigger when the email is from an address containing `acme.com`.
- **Benefits**:
    - Prevents unnecessary task runs on irrelevant events
    - Reduces credit consumption from high-volume triggers
    - Ensures only relevant data gets processed

### 2. Use a Cheaper Model

Lindy offers a range of language models from basic to advanced. While advanced models provide more nuanced responses for complex tasks, they also cost more credits. In many cases, a cheaper model works just as well.

 **Model Selection Strategy:**
- **Evaluate Your Needs:** Consider task complexity. For straightforward responses, summarization, or limited actions, basic models are often effective
- **Experiment:** Try executing tasks with cheaper models and compare outcomes
- **Start Big, Then Optimize:** Begin with bigger models to get workflows right, then gradually downgrade to optimize costs
- **Monitor Performance:** Watch for drops in effectiveness and weigh cost savings against performance

### 3. Clear Context to Reduce Credit Usage

Every time your agent processes a task, it carries forward conversation history as context. This quickly increases credit consumption, especially when analyzing large amounts of data like webpage contents or spreadsheet processing.

- **The Problem**: Expensive operations often happen because your agent manages memory and context throughout the entire workflow, carrying unnecessary historical data.
- **The Solution**: Add `Clear Task Context` actions in your workflows after significant data processing steps. This resets conversation memory, ensuring your agent only carries forward relevant information.

**When to Use Clear Context:**
- After extracting webpage contents
- Following large data processing steps  
- Between major workflow phases
- When switching between different types of tasks

### 4. Use Cheaper Actions

Some actions have different credit costs. Compare action costs and choose more efficient alternatives when possible.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trigger Optimization">
    - Set up specific filters for high-volume triggers like emails
    - Use domain-based filtering (e.g., only emails from specific companies)
    - Filter by subject lines, sender types, or content keywords
    - Test filters to ensure they catch relevant events without overfiltering
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Management">
    - Start with more powerful models during development
    - Gradually downgrade while monitoring quality
    - Use basic models for simple tasks like data routing or notifications
    - Reserve advanced models for complex reasoning or analysis
    - Document which models work best for each workflow type
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory and Context Strategy">
    - Use Clear Context after processing large data sets
    - Clear context between distinct workflow phases
    - Keep only essential information in memory
    - Monitor credit consumption patterns to identify context bloat
    - Test workflows with and without context clearing to measure impact
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Action Selection">
    - Compare credit costs for different actions that achieve similar results
    - Consider alternatives like Perplexity for research tasks
    - Evaluate whether premium actions are necessary for your use case
    - Check action costs in the Flow Editor before adding them
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring and Testing

### Track Your Optimizations
- Use the task view to monitor credit consumption per step
- Compare costs before and after implementing optimizations
- Set up regular reviews of your highest-cost workflows
- Document which strategies work best for different types of automations

### Gradual Implementation
- Make one optimization at a time to measure impact
- Test model downgrades on non-critical workflows first
- Implement filters gradually to avoid breaking existing automations
- Keep backup versions of workflows before making changes
