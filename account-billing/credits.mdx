## Overview

Credits are the currency at the core of Lindy's billing system. Understanding how they work helps you optimize costs and plan your automation workflows. Perfect for:

- **Cost planning** — understand what drives credit consumption in your workflows
- **Usage monitoring** — track credit spending across tasks and models
- **Optimization** — reduce costs while maintaining automation effectiveness

Most tasks cost about `1-3 credits` on small models and `10 credits` on Large models, with costs varying based on AI model choice, task complexity, and actions used.

<Tip>
Basic models often work well for simple tasks. Start with more powerful models to get workflows right, then downgrade while monitoring results to find the optimal balance.
</Tip>

## What are Credits?

Credits determine the cost of each task based on the AI model you use, task complexity, and actions included in your workflow.

**Every task is at minimum 1 credit.** Tasks that include premium actions or LLM calls will consume more credits. Credit costs scale with:

- **Model intelligence** — more advanced models use more credits
- **Task complexity** — processing hundreds of spreadsheet rows vs. updating one row
- **Premium actions** — specialized integrations and features
- **AI agent duration** — agents run until completion, using more credits for longer tasks

### What is a Task?

A task is everything your agent does after being triggered by an event or user message. Tasks begin when a workflow is initiated and include all subsequent steps — conditions, actions, AI agent steps, and messages.

## Monitoring Your Credits

Track credit usage through Lindy's task view and sidebar gauge:

### Task View
1. **Click your Lindy** in the sidebar and select "Tasks"
2. **Access a task** from the task list
3. **Hover over each step** to see credits used for that specific step

    />
  </div>

### Total Usage
- **Bottom left gauge** shows billing credit consumption for current cycle
- **Hover for details** to see when credit balance resets for next billing cycle

<Warning>
Credits do not roll over between billing cycles. When you run out of credits, your agents pause operations and new tasks are put on hold.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimize Credit Usage">
    - **Filter High-Volume Triggers** - Only allow actions on relevant events with specific filters (e.g., limit email triggers to specific domains)
    - **Use Cheaper Models** - Basic models work well for simple tasks; evaluate if you need advanced capabilities
    - **Test and Monitor** - Start with powerful models, then gradually downgrade while monitoring results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor and Plan">
    - Check the task view regularly to understand credit consumption patterns
    - Use the sidebar gauge to track monthly usage
    - Set up workflows gradually to understand their credit impact
    - Review premium action usage to identify optimization opportunities
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Selection Strategy">
    - Start with mid-tier models for development and testing
    - Use advanced models only when you need their specific capabilities
    - Consider task complexity when choosing models
    - Monitor results when downgrading to ensure quality maintains
  </Accordion>
