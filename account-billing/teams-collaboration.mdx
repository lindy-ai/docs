In this guide, you will learn how to empower your whole team with AI agents.

## Lindy for Teams

Our teams features allow users to invite, share, and collaborate on different agents, unlocking centralized, sharable, and company-maintained agents (e.g. employee support, on-brand copywriting, data science, etc.)

With our teams features, you can:
- Add users to your workspace
- Share billing
- Share edit access to your agents
- Share user access to your agents
- Migrate your agents between workspaces

<Info>
Pro Plan Required: Teams features are only available on Pro plans and above. You'll need to upgrade to invite team members and share agents.
</Info>

## Workspace Settings

To access your workspace settings, click on your Workspace name in the top left and choose `Settings` in the dropdown. Here, you can:
- Change your workspace name, URL, and logo
- Manage your shared billing
- Manage your team members and permissions

## Members and Permissions

In your workspace settings, you can invite members to your workspace and assign permissions to team members. We have 3 different account-level permissions:

- **Owner**: Has full control over the workspace including deleting it, updating payment methods, changing team settings, transferring ownership, and managing all aspects of the subscription
- **Admin**: Can manage team members, upgrade/manage subscription, inspect spend allocation, create agents, and use agents, but cannot delete the workspace or transfer ownership
- **Team member**: Can create and use agents, but has limited administrative privileges and cannot manage billing or team settings

To invite members or edit permissions, navigate to 'Members' in your workspace settings.

## Sharing Agents

To share an agent, click on the Share button in the top right of your agent's flow editor or tasks view.

You are able to share edit access, user access, or as a template:

- **Edit access**: Those with edit access can edit the agent, and see all tasks for that agent
- **User access**: Those with user access can use the agent and run tasks. They'll only be able to see their own tasks. Only agents that have a Lindy Chat Message Received trigger or no trigger are eligible to be shared with the "user access" permission.
- **Template**: Sharing as a template allows others to make a copy of your agent into their own accounts.

## Migrating Agents

You can migrate your agents from one workspace to another. Simply select the agents you want to move, and the workspace you want to move them to:
