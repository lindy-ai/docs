## Overview

Workspaces allow you to organize your agents and resources into separate environments. Perfect for:

- **Team collaboration** — share billing with teammates
- **Resource isolation** — keep different projects or clients separate
- **Multi-environment management** — switch between personal and team workspaces

All your agents exist within your workspace, making it easy to organize and manage your automation workflows while collaborating with others.

## Workspace Creation and Management

### Initial Workspace Creation
When you join Lindy, you automatically create your first workspace. This becomes your personal workspace where you can build and manage your agents.

### Multiple Workspaces
You can have multiple workspaces to organize different projects.

- **Personal workspace** - for your individual agents and experiments
- **[Team workspaces](/account-billing/teams)** – shared environments for collaborative projects

## Workspace Collaboration

### Inviting Team Members

<Note>
  Pro Plan Required: You can only invite team members to your workspace if you're on a Pro plan or above.
</Note>

To add someone to your workspace:

1. **Click on the top left** - Access your workspace settings
2. **Invite a member** - Send an invitation to your teammate
3. **Share access** - They gain access to your workspace

### Billing Sharing
When you invite members to your workspace:
- **Shared billing** - All workspace activity is billed to the workspace owner
- **Unlimited invites** - You can invite as many people as you want
- **Centralized costs** - All credit consumption and billing is tracked under the owner of the account
- **Plan inheritance** - Team members get access to the workspace's plan features

## Workspace Switching

You can click on your workspace in the top left and then switch to a different workspace.
