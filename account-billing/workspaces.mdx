## Overview

Workspaces allow you to organize your Lindys and resources into separate environments. Perfect for:

- **Team collaboration** - share Lindys and billing with teammates
- **Resource isolation** - keep different projects or clients separate
- **Multi-environment management** - switch between personal and team workspaces

All your Lindys exist within your workspace, making it easy to organize and manage your automation workflows while collaborating with others.

## Workspace Creation and Management

### Initial Workspace Creation
When you join Lindy, you automatically create your first workspace. This becomes your personal workspace where you can build and manage your Lindys.

### Multiple Workspaces
You can have multiple workspaces to organize different projects.

- **Personal workspace** - for your individual Lindys and experiments
- **Team workspaces** - shared environments for collaborative projects

### Joining Teammate Workspaces
You can join a teammate's workspace to collaborate on shared Lindys and projects. When you join someone else's workspace, you gain access to their Lindys and can collaborate on automation workflows.

## Workspace Collaboration

### Inviting Team Members
To add someone to your workspace:

1. **Click on the top left** - Access your workspace settings
2. **Invite a member** - Send an invitation to your teammate
3. **Share access** - They gain access to your workspace and Lindys

### Billing Sharing
When you invite members to your workspace:
- **Shared billing** - All workspace activity is billed to the workspace owner
- **Unlimited invites** - You can invite as many people as you want
- **Centralized costs** - All credit consumption and billing is tracked under the owner of the account

## Workspace Switching

You can click on your workspace in the top left and then switch to a different workspace.
