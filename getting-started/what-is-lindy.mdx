## The problem with repetitive work

Every day, knowledge workers spend 40% of their time on repetitive tasks. Email responses, data entry, meeting notes, customer support tickets - the list goes on. These tasks are necessary but not strategic. They're perfect for automation.

## Enter Lindy: Your AI workforce

Lindy is an AI agent platform that lets you build intelligent automations without writing a single line of code. Think of Lindy as your team of AI assistants, each specialized in different tasks, working 24/7 to handle your repetitive work.

## How Lindy is different

### 🎯 No-code, truly

Unlike other "no-code" tools that still require technical knowledge, Lindy is designed for everyone. If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can build it.

### ⚡ Minutes to value

Most automation tools take weeks to implement. With Lindy, you'll have your first agent running in under 5 minutes.

### 🧠 Actually intelligent

Lindy uses cutting-edge AI to understand context, make decisions, and handle edge cases - just like a human assistant would.

## Key concepts to understand

Before diving in, familiarize yourself with these core concepts:

- **Agents**: Your AI workers that perform specific tasks
- **Triggers**: Events that start your automations
- **Actions**: What your agents do in response to triggers
- **Integrations**: Connect to 100+ tools you already use
