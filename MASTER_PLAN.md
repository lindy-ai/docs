**Remember**: Every page should make users feel empowered and excited to build with Lindy! 

---

### 1. **Video File Path or Name Issue**
- The video file must be accessible at `/videos/triggers.mp4` relative to your site’s public root.
- Double-check that the file is actually at `docs/videos/triggers.mp4` and that your static file server exposes the `docs/videos` directory as `/videos`.

**Test:**  
Try opening `http://localhost:3000/videos/triggers.mp4` directly in your browser.  
- If you get a 404 or nothing loads, the file is not being served correctly.

---

### 2. **MDX/Framework Static Assets Location**
- Some documentation frameworks (like Mintlify, Next.js, Docusaurus, etc.) require static assets to be in a specific folder (often called `public` or `static` at the project root).
- If you put the video in `docs/videos`, but your framework expects it in `public/videos`, it won’t be found.

**Solution:**  
- Move your video to the correct static folder (often `public/videos/triggers.mp4` at the root of your project, not inside `docs/`).

---

### 3. **File Permissions or Corruption**
- Make sure the video file is not corrupted and is readable by the server.

---

### 4. **Browser/Console Errors**
- Open your browser’s developer console and look for errors related to loading the video file.

---

## **How to Fix**

1. **Move the video file to the correct static directory.**  
   - If your project has a `public` folder, move the video to `public/videos/triggers.mp4`.
   - If not, let me know your framework and I’ll tell you the right place.

2. **Update the MDX video source if needed:**  
   ```mdx
   <video
     src="/videos/triggers.mp4"
     width="600"
     autoPlay
     muted
     loop
     playsInline
     style={{ borderRadius: '16px', boxShadow: '0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)' }}
   />
   ```

3. **Reload your site and check if the video appears.**

---

Would you like me to move the file to a `public/videos` directory and update the reference? If you tell me your framework (Mintlify, Next.js, etc.), I can give you the exact path!
