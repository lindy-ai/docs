# AI Agents

## What Are Lindy AI Agents?

### The building blocks of your AI workforce

**Lindy agents are AI-powered assistants that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with your tools - just like a human employee would.**

Think of them as digital team members that never sleep, never take breaks, and can handle repetitive tasks with perfect consistency. Each agent specializes in specific workflows and can work independently or collaborate with other agents.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Insight:**
Unlike traditional automation tools that follow rigid rules, Lindy agents use AI to understand context, make intelligent decisions, and adapt to new situations.

## Agent Anatomy

### Every Lindy agent consists of four core components

**1. Triggers**

What starts your agent's work:
- Time-based schedules (every hour, daily at 9am)
- Event-based triggers (new email, form submission)
- Webhooks from external systems
- Manual activation

**2. Actions**

What your agent can do:
- Send emails and messages
- Update spreadsheets and databases
- Make API calls
- Create calendar events
- Process and analyze data

**3. Conditions**

How your agent makes decisions:
- If/then logic for different scenarios
- Pattern matching in text
- Data validation rules
- Multi-path workflows

**4. Knowledge Base**

What your agent knows:
- Company information and policies
- Product details and pricing
- Common questions and answers
- Historical context from past interactions

ðŸ’¡ **Example Configuration:**
`When email received â†’ If contains "urgent" â†’ Send Slack notification â†’ Create high-priority ticket`

## Creating Your First Agent

### Follow these steps to build an agent in minutes

**Step 1: Choose Your Use Case**

Start with a specific task you want to automate. The more focused, the better your agent will perform.

**Step 2: Define Triggers**

Decide what should activate your agent:
- **Email trigger**: "When I receive an email to support@company.com"
- **Schedule trigger**: "Every morning at 9 AM"
- **Form trigger**: "When someone submits our contact form"

**Step 3: Add Actions**

Tell your agent what to do:
- Read and analyze the incoming data
- Make decisions based on your rules
- Take action in connected tools
- Report results back to you

**Step 4: Test and Refine**

Run your agent in test mode to ensure it works correctly, then activate it for real-world use.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:**
Start simple! Build a basic agent first, then add complexity as you learn what works best for your workflow.

## Agent States and Monitoring

### Understanding how agents operate

**Agent States**

Your agents can be in one of four states:

- **Active** - Currently running and processing tasks
- **Idle** - Waiting for triggers to activate
- **Paused** - Temporarily disabled by user
- **Error** - Encountered an issue requiring attention

**Monitoring Your Agents**

Track agent performance with:
- Real-time activity logs
- Success/failure rates
- Processing time metrics
- Credit usage analytics

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Best Practice:**
Set up notifications for agent errors so you can quickly address any issues that arise.

## Advanced Agent Features

### Take your agents to the next level

**Human in the Loop**

Add approval checkpoints for sensitive actions:
- Review draft emails before sending
- Approve large purchases or changes
- Validate data before processing

**Multi-Agent Workflows**

Chain agents together for complex processes:
- Agent 1: Qualify incoming leads
- Agent 2: Enrich lead data
- Agent 3: Assign to sales rep
- Agent 4: Send personalized follow-up

**Custom Code Actions**

Write JavaScript for advanced logic:

ðŸ’¡ `// Calculate custom metrics
const score = (opens * 2 + clicks * 5) / sends;
return score > 0.15 ? "High engagement" : "Low engagement";`
</aside>
