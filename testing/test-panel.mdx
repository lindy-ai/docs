## Overview

The Test Panel lets you test your agents in real-time before deploying them. Perfect for:

- **Testing workflows**: run your agent step-by-step to see exactly what happens
- **Debugging issues**: identify problems in your agent's logic or configuration  
- **Validating triggers**: test different trigger scenarios and inputs

## How to Use the Test Panel

1. **Open the Test Panel** - Click the test button in the top right corner of your agent builder

</Frame>

2. **Select Your Trigger** 
   - A right panel will appear where you can choose from available triggers
   - If you have multiple triggers, you'll see multiple trigger options to start from
   - Click the trigger you want to test

3. **Run and Monitor** 
   - Your agent will execute step-by-step
   - Watch each action happen in real-time
   - See outputs, errors, and decision points
   - Follow the complete workflow from start to finish

<Tip>
The first 500 credits per test run are free! This gives you plenty of credits to thoroughly test your workflows before going live.

## Important Notes

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Real-time Testing">
    The test panel shows actual execution - not a simulation. Actions will really run, APIs will be called, and data will be processed. Use test data when possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Google Sheets Testing">
    When testing Google Sheets, it can often take 2-5 minutes for new rows to populate in the test panel. Be patient - this is because of the Google API.
