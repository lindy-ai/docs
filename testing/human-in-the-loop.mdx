## Overview

There are three ways to build your agents to include human oversight when needed. You can always determine when you want to be in the loop for your agents - start with oversight and gradually increase autonomy as you build confidence.

## 1. Ask for Confirmation

Most actions have a confirmation toggle for actions with "side effects" (like sending emails, updating records, or creating events).

### How It Works
- **Enable the toggle** — Turn on "Ask for Confirmation" for any action
- **Agent pauses** — Your agent will execute up to that action, then wait for your approval
- **Receive email** — You'll get an email asking you to approve the action
- **Approve in app** — You can also approve it directly in the task menu
- **Agent continues** — Once approved, your agent completes the workflow

## 2. Condition-Based Alerts

Use condition steps to have your agent send alerts when it encounters situations outside its scope or gets stuck.

### Setting Up Conditional Human Loops
- **Add a condition** — Create conditions like "if this happens" or "if this is outside your scope" or "if unknown"
- **Send alerts** — When the condition is met, have the agent send an email or Slack message
- **Get notified** — Receive a ping saying "Hey, your agent is stuck and needs help"
- **Take action** — Step in to help or provide guidance when needed

This approach lets your agent run autonomously most of the time but alerts you when it needs human intervention.

## 3. Draft Modes

Certain actions like Gmail can create drafts instead of executing immediately, giving you manual review before final action.

### Gmail Draft Mode
- **Creates drafts** — Emails are saved to your Gmail drafts folder instead of being sent
- **Manual review** — You can edit, approve, or delete drafts before sending
- **Maintains context** — All email details (recipients, subject, body) are preserved
- **Flexible timing** — Send when you're ready, not when the agent runs

<Tip>
Draft modes are particularly useful for customer communications, negotiations, or sensitive outreach where tone and timing matter.

## When to Use Human in the Loop

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Starting New Agents">
    Always start with human oversight for actions that affect other people. Test thoroughly with confirmation enabled, then gradually increase autonomy as you build confidence in your agent's performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="External Communications">
    Use confirmation for emails, messages, and outreach to customers, leads, or partners. This ensures tone, timing, and content meet your standards before reaching recipients.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Modifications">
    Enable oversight for actions that create, update, or delete important records. This prevents accidental data loss or corruption while your agent learns your preferences.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High-Value Decisions">
    Require approval for actions involving money, contracts, scheduling, or other high-stakes decisions that could impact your business or relationships.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
