## Overview

Lindy makes building agents easy, but occasional errors can occur. This guide helps you quickly identify, understand, and resolve common issues. Perfect for:

- **Error identification** - spot problems in task history and flow editor
- **Quick fixes** - resolve common setup mistakes and configuration issues  
- **HTTP troubleshooting** - understand external service connection errors

Most agent errors come down to simple setup mistakes—missing skills, unclear prompts, or undefined exit conditions. It's rarely a system issue. Before assuming something's broken, double-check your configuration—the fix is usually right there.

## How to Identify an Error

When an error occurs, Lindy notifies you directly within your Task History, Flow Editor, and via email, so you can address issues immediately.

### Review Errors in Flow Editor Using Test Mode
1. **Open the workflow** - Go to your workflow in the editor
2. **Enter Test Mode** - Click the test button
3. **Run your test** - Execute the workflow to see where it fails

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/debugging5.png" />
</Frame>

Lindy will usually tell you where and why it got stuck. In this case, we offer an "Edit action configuration" button that opens the erroring step.

### Review Errors in Task History
1. **Go to Tasks View** - Navigate to the Tasks section
2. **Look for errored tasks** - Find tasks marked as "Errored"
3. **Click for details** - Review exactly what Lindy executed before the failure and see suggested fixes

<Frame>

</Frame>

This is the primary place to identify what went wrong. If available, use the provided button to configure the action step or trigger that failed.

<Tip>
When an error occurs, Lindy emails you with details about the issue and possible troubleshooting steps.
</Tip>

## General Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check the Error Message** 
 - Use the Testing Panel to review all messages sent within the workflow. The error message will often indicate what went wrong and how to resolve it.

2. **Review Triggers and Action Steps** 
 - Ensure all triggers and action steps are set up correctly. Check that the correct inputs, conditions, and dependencies are in place.

3. **Monitor Outages** 
 - If an integrated app is down, Lindy will notify you. You can also check the app's status page for real-time updates.

## Common Errors and Fixes

### "The Input provided is too long"
This means the task context is exceeding the allowed limit. To resolve this:
- Filter unnecessary high-volume triggers
- Use a more cost-efficient language model  
- Optimize the workflow to minimize redundant data

### "Cannot start test. Cannot find the conversation trigger"
This error usually indicates a misconfiguration with triggers:
- Verify trigger setup in the workflow
- Ensure event-based triggers have the right conditions
- Check if multiple triggers conflict with each other

### "My apologies [Name], I'm having trouble completing this task"
This typically means the agent is unable to complete its assigned task. Possible fixes:

**Missing Exit Condition** 

- If the agent is handling a complex task or using multiple skills, it may not know when to stop.
- **Fix**: Define a clear exit condition, so the agent knows when the task is complete

</Frame>

**Skills Issue** 
- The agent may lack the necessary skills to finish the task.
- **Fix**: Assign the required skills, keeping the total below four skills per agent for most tasks

</Frame>

**Prompt Issue** 
- The instructions might be unclear or too vague.
- **Fix**: Refine the prompt to ensure the agent fully understands the task

### "Failed to save the current flow"
This error typically indicates a misconfiguration in the trigger:
- Verify that a trigger is set up – ensure your workflow has an active trigger
- Check the trigger configuration – review settings like authentication, permissions, and required parameters

</Frame>

### "My Email received trigger does not fire in test mode"
- If you email yourself and the sender and recipient email addresses are the same, it won't trigger the Email Received trigger. This prevents infinite loops.
- **Fix**: Use a different email address to test the trigger

### "Task Stopped Due to Insufficient Credits"
- If a Lindy task stops because of credit limits, it won't automatically restart.
- **Fix**: Go to your Lindy → Task View, find the incomplete task, and click "Retry" to continue from where it stopped

## HTTP Status Codes

Lindy interacts with various external services, and sometimes errors come from those connections. Here's what common HTTP error codes mean:

| Code | Error | What it means |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **400** | Bad Request | The request was incorrect—double-check your input data |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Authentication is missing or incorrect |
| **403** | Forbidden | You don't have permission to access this resource |
| **404** | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist |
| **422** | Unprocessable Entity | Data format is invalid |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | You've hit a rate limit—try again later |
| **500** | Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on the external service's end |

<Warning>
Some HTTP errors in Lindy originate from third-party services, meaning the issue is often outside Lindy's control. While some errors can be fixed by adjusting your configuration, others may require checking the third-party provider's documentation.
</Warning>

## How to Report a Bug

If you suspect a bug or need help with Lindy, report it through these channels:

- **Email**: Send an email to support@lindy.ai
- **Slack Community**: Post in the Lindy Community

### Make sure to include a task URL!

Providing the task URL helps us look directly into the issue:

1. **Click your Lindy agent** → click "Tasks"
2. **Find the task** you need help with
3. **Click the specific task** (you should see the full execution)
4. **Copy that page URL** from your browser
5. **Paste the URL** in your support request

<Tip>
The URL should include "conversationID" followed by a number. Screenshots are also helpful!

  <Accordion title="Prevention Strategies">
    - Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity
    - Test each action step individually before connecting them
    - Use clear, specific prompts for AI agents
    - Define exit conditions for complex tasks
    - Keep skill assignments under four per agent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Debugging Workflow">
    - Always check Task History first for error details
    - Use Test Mode to isolate problem steps
    - Review error messages carefully for specific guidance
    - Check third-party service status pages for outages
    - Document recurring issues and their solutions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When to Get Help">
