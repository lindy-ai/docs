## Overview

Version History lets you view and restore previous versions of your agent. Perfect for:

- **Reverting changes** — go back to a working version if something breaks
- **Comparing versions** — see what changed between different iterations
- **Recovering work** — restore accidentally deleted or modified configurations

## How to Access Version History

1. **Find the agent title** — In the top left of your Flow editor, locate your agent's title
2. **Click the dropdown** — Click on the agent title to open the dropdown menu  
3. **Select Version History** — Choose "Version History" from the dropdown options

## Viewing and Restoring Versions

Once in Version History, you can:

- **Browse all versions** — See a chronological list of your agent's versions
- **Review changes** — Check what was modified in each version
- **Restore any version** — Select a previous version to restore

### How Restoration Works

When you restore a previous version:
1. **Select the version** you want to restore from the list
2. **Click restore** to load that version into your editor
3. **Make any adjustments** if needed
4. **Save your agent** — this creates a new version with the restored configuration

<Tip>
Restoring a version doesn't delete your current work — it creates a new version once you save, so you can always go back to recent changes if needed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

  <Accordion title="Version Management">
    - Save frequently to create regular save points and have more restoration options
    - Use descriptive names when significant changes are made
    - Test before major changes by saving a working version first
