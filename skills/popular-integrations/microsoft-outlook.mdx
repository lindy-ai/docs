## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email Automation Setup">
    Get the most out of Outlook email workflows:
    - Always use filters on Email Received triggers to avoid processing every email
    - Start with draft actions first, then switch to direct sending once tested
    - Use organizational accounts instead of personal accounts for business workflows
    - Test with a small group before rolling out approval workflows company-wide
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Managing Sequences & Replies">
    Handle email conversations effectively:
    - Use "After email sent" for follow-up sequences and reminders
    - Use "After reply received" only when you need to process responses
    - Keep track of multiple email threads when running parallel conversations
    - Set up clear exit conditions for email sequences to avoid loops
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Calendar & Contact Integration">
    Optimize scheduling and contact management:
    - Sync Outlook contacts with your CRM to avoid duplicate data entry
    - Use timezone-aware calendar events for global team coordination
    - Set up automated meeting follow-ups using calendar triggers
    - Keep contact data clean by updating rather than creating new records
  </Accordion>
