## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### Building Your First Slack Bot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Lindy">
    Start by creating a new agent specifically for Slack automation.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/slack_1.png" alt="Creating a new Lindy agent for Slack integration" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Slack Message Trigger">
    Click on "Select Trigger" and choose "Slack Message Received" from the list of available triggers. This will make your bot wake up whenever a message is posted in your Slack workspace.
    
    In the trigger configuration:
    - **Channel Selection**: Choose specific channels to monitor (like #support or #general) or select "All" to monitor your entire workspace
    - **Direct Messages**: Enable if you want the bot to respond to private messages
    - **Integration Setup**: Authorize your Slack workspace by clicking "Connect" and following the OAuth flow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up Filters (Optional)">
    Add trigger filters to control when your bot responds and avoid unnecessary activations:
    
    Filter by Keywords : Set the bot to only trigger when messages contain specific words
    - Example: "Hey Lindy", "help", "support", "question"
    
    Filter by Users: Exclude or include specific team members
    - Useful to prevent the bot from responding to other bots or specific users
    
    Filter by Channels: Fine-tune which channels trigger the bot even if monitoring "All"
    - Example: Exclude #random or #general but include #support
    
    **Advanced Filters**: Use conditions like "message starts with" or "message contains question mark"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Conditions">
    Click the "+" button and select "Condition" to create smart routing logic that determines when your bot should actually respond:
    
    Example Conditions:
    - "the message contains a question about company policies or procedures"
    - "the user is asking for help with our product or service"
    - "the message is a support request that needs immediate attention"
    
    Why Use Conditions: They ensure your bot only responds to relevant messages, improving accuracy and preventing spam. You can add multiple conditions to create different response paths.
    
    Best Practice: Start with broad conditions and refine them based on actual usage patterns.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect Knowledge Base">
    Add a "Search Knowledge Base" step to give your bot access to company information:
    
    Knowledge Base Setup:
    - Upload your company documentation, FAQs, policies, and procedures
    - Include website content, Notion pages, Google Docs, or PDF files
    - Organize content by categories (HR, IT, Product, etc.)
    
    Search Configuration:
    - Set the search to look for relevant information based on the user's question
    - Configure how many results to return (typically 3-5 for best performance)
    - Choose between semantic search (meaning-based) or keyword search
    
    Content Tips: Keep your knowledge base updated and well-organized for best results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Response Action">
    Add a "Send Message" action to define how your bot responds:
    
    Message Configuration:
    - **Channel**: Choose to respond in the same channel, send a DM, or post to a specific channel
    - **Thread Reply**: Enable to keep conversations organized within message threads
    
    Response Prompt: Write clear instructions for how the bot should respond:
    ```
    "Answer the user's question using information from the knowledge base. 
    Be helpful and concise. If you can't find the answer, suggest who 
    they should contact or how to get help. Always maintain a friendly, 
    professional tone that matches our company culture."
    ```
    
    Advanced Options: 
    - Add fallback responses for when no knowledge base match is found
    - Include escalation paths to human team members
    - Set up follow-up actions like logging the interaction
  </Step>
</Steps>
