## Overview

Google Drive integration provides file storage and management capabilities. Automate file operations, manage folders, control permissions, and implement powerful search functionality across your Google Drive ecosystem.

## Authentication & Permissions

Secure authentication with granular permission controls ensures your Google Drive integration operates safely within your organization's security policies.

When you connect Google Drive, Lindy requests permissions to:
- **See, edit, create, and delete** all Google Drive files
- **Access shared drives** and team folders
- **Manage file permissions** and sharing settings
- **Monitor file changes** and folder modifications

<Tip>
Lindy only uses these permissions to access files and folders you specifically configure in your workflows. This access is required by Google's API to work properly, but Lindy will only interact with the files you direct it to.
</Tip>
