## Smart Email Sequences & Reply Monitoring

</Frame>

Gmail actions can create intelligent email sequences that automatically monitor and respond to replies. After you send an email, Lindy can watch for responses and take follow-up actions, creating powerful automated conversations:

- **After email sent**: Automatically monitor for replies, set reminders, or trigger follow-up actions
- **After reply received**: Process responses, extract information, or escalate conversations

This enables reactive workflows where your agent can handle both sending emails and intelligently responding to replies.

## Conversation Management & Thread Assignment

### Special Conversation Actions

- **Observe Thread**: Monitor your inbox for new emails in ongoing conversations. The system will alert you when new emails arrive, creating a monitoring point for email surveillance.
- **Send Reply (Linked)**: Draft or send a reply to an email within the context of a monitored conversation.

### Managing Multiple Email Conversations

<Frame>

</Frame>

When running multiple email workflows simultaneously, you need to assign the proper conversation thread to ensure actions target the correct email exchange. This prevents mixing up different email conversations and ensures each response goes to the right person.

**How it works:**
- Send multiple emails that monitor for replies
- Each email creates its own conversation thread
- When replies come in, select which specific conversation you're responding to
- Each conversation maintains its own context and history

## Email Filtering Best Practices

When using the "Email Received" trigger, always use filters to target specific emails. Without filters, you'll receive notifications for every email, which can overwhelm your automation.

- Use sender filters: `from:specific@email.com`
- Subject line filters: `subject:urgent OR subject:important`
- Label-based triggers for pre-organized emails
- Attachment filters for document processing workflows

HTML Email Signatures: In the signature field, you can include HTML email signatures for rich formatting, images, and professional branding.
