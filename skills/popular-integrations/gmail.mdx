## Overview

Gmail integration provides comprehensive email automation for sending, receiving, organizing, and managing email workflows. Create sophisticated email sequences with stateful actions and thread-aware responses.

## Getting Started

Connect your Gmail account to enable powerful email automation. Set up triggers to respond to incoming emails, sent messages, attachments, and label changes. Use filters to target specific emails and avoid information overload.

<Frame>

</Frame>

Gmail actions are stateful, meaning after you send an email, Lindy can automatically monitor and respond to replies or take follow-up actions. This creates powerful email sequences:

- **After email sent**: Automatically monitor for replies, set reminders, or trigger follow-up actions
- **After reply received**: Process responses, extract information, or escalate conversations

## Linked Actions & Thread Management

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/gmail-linked-actions.png" alt="Gmail linked actions showing Observe thread and Send Reply capabilities [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

### Special Linked Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Observe Thread">
    Observe the user's inbox for matching new emails. The system will send you a message when new email(s) are received. This action anchors a new monitoring point for ongoing email surveillance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Send Reply (Linked)">
    Draft or send a reply to an email within the context of a monitored thread.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Thread Assignment for Multiple Workflows

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/gmail-multiple-stateful-assign-thread.png" alt="Gmail thread assignment interface for managing multiple concurrent email workflows [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

When running multiple stateful email workflows simultaneously, you must assign the proper thread to ensure actions target the correct conversation. This prevents cross-contamination between different email sequences.

</Tip>

### Email Filtering Best Practices

<Note>
Important: When using the "Email Received" trigger, always use filters to target specific emails. Without filters, you'll receive notifications for every email, which can overwhelm your automation.
</Note>

- Use sender filters: `from:specific@email.com`
- Subject line filters: `subject:urgent OR subject:important`
- Label-based triggers for pre-organized emails
- Attachment filters for document processing workflows

### Thread Management

- **Single workflow**: Thread assignment happens automatically
- **Multiple workflows**: Manually assign threads to prevent conflicts
- **Observe actions**: Create new monitoring anchors for ongoing surveillance
- **Stateful sequences**: Plan your email journey from send to final resolution

## Best Practices

- Start with simple send/receive automation before building complex sequences
- Test email filters thoroughly to avoid missing important messages
- Use draft actions for human review before sending sensitive emails
- Implement proper error handling for failed email deliveries
- Monitor thread assignments in multi-workflow scenarios
