- Leverage chat messages for direct, targeted communications
- Implement error handling for API rate limits
- Test automations in dedicated test channels first

<Tip>
Microsoft Teams actions integrate seamlessly with Office 365 tools, making it perfect for organizations already using the Microsoft ecosystem.
