## Quick Overview

Google Calendar integration is one of Lindy's most powerful features, enabling your AI agents to act as sophisticated scheduling assistants and calendar managers. The integration provides both Triggers (what can start a Lindy workflow) and  Actions (what Lindy can do).

This comprehensive integration makes Lindy one of the most powerful calendar management AI assistants available, capable of handling everything from simple event creation to complex multi-party scheduling coordination and intelligent calendar optimization.

Key benefits of Google Calendar integration:
- **Intelligent scheduling** – Find optimal meeting times across multiple calendars
- **Real-time automation** – Trigger workflows when events start, end, or change
- **Multi-calendar support** – Work across personal, work, and shared calendars seamlessly
