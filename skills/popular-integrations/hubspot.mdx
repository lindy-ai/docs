## HubSpot Triggers

#### New Or Updated Contact 
Monitors for new contacts or changes to existing contact records:
- **Configurable polling** - Default 15-minute intervals (900 seconds) with customization
- **Property selection** - Dynamic selection of additional properties to retrieve
- **List filtering** - Optional monitoring of specific contact lists

<Tip>
We recommend keeping polling at 900 seconds (15 minutes) because of HubSpot rate limits. This ensures reliable performance without hitting API restrictions.
</Tip>

Triggers when specific contact properties are modified:
- **Dynamic property selection** - Choose from all contact properties
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track critical field changes instantly

Monitors for new deals or changes to existing deal records:
- **Pipeline filtering** - Optional filtering by specific sales pipelines

#### New Deal In Stage 

Triggers when deals enter specific pipeline stages:
- **Pipeline selection** - Dynamic list of all available pipelines
- **Stage targeting** - Dependent stage selection based on chosen pipeline

#### New Form Submission 

Triggers when forms are submitted on your website:

<Tip>
  Use "New Deal In Stage" triggers combined with "Update Deal" actions for the most powerful sales pipeline automation workflows.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choosing the Right Triggers">
    Pick the best trigger for your workflow:
    - Use "New Form Submission" for immediate lead response (fastest activation)
    - Use "New Deal In Stage" when you need stage-specific automation 
    - Avoid "New Or Updated Contact" for high-volume accounts unless you have a strong filter
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Setting Up Reliable Workflows">
    - Always test with real data before going live
    - Start with one trigger and one action, then add complexity
    - Use Search Contacts before Create Contact to avoid duplicates
    - Set up error notifications so you know when something breaks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Managing Data Quality">
    Keep your CRM clean and useful:
    - Use Update Contact instead of Create Contact when the person might already exist
    - Always create associations between contacts, deals, and companies
    - Log all important communications with Create Communication
    - Use lists to segment contacts before running bulk operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoiding Common Mistakes">
    Prevent workflow problems before they happen:
    - Don't use multiple triggers that could fire at the same time
    - Keep polling at 900 seconds to avoid hitting rate limits
    - Test triggers with small data sets first before scaling up
