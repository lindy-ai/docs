<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/daily-engineering-digest.png" alt="Daily Engineering Digest workflow showing scheduled trigger, repository loop, and Slack notification" />
</Frame>

This automated workflow demonstrates how to create comprehensive engineering reports by analyzing multiple repositories and sending digest summaries to your team.

### Workflow Components

**Scheduled Trigger**: Runs daily to generate consistent reporting.

**Repository Loop**: Iterates through a list of repositories to gather comprehensive data.

**Issue Analysis**: Collects both open and closed issues to track progress and workload.

**Code Analysis**: Processes repository activity and generates insights.

**Team Notification**: Sends formatted digest to Slack channels.

### Setup Process

1. **Configure Schedule**: Set up a recurring trigger for your preferred digest frequency
2. **Define Repository List**: Create a list of repositories to monitor
3. **Add Loop Logic**: Use "Enter Loop" to process each repository
4. **Collect Issue Data**: Gather open and closed issues for each repository
5. **Analyze Activity**: Process the collected data for insights
6. **Format Output**: Create a digestible summary format
7. **Send Notification**: Deliver the digest via Slack or email

<Tip>
  For the Daily Engineering Digest, start with a small set of repositories to test your workflow before scaling to your entire organization.
