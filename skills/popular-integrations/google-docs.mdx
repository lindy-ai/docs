## Google Docs Triggers

#### New Document Created 
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/docs_3.png" alt="Google Docs connection" />
</Frame>
Fires the moment a brand-new Google Doc appears in a chosen folder:
- **Folder filtering** - Optionally select specific folder, defaults to watching entire Drive
- **Dynamic payload** - Provides title, url, documentId, createdTime, creatorEmail, parentFolders
- Perfect for auto-formatting new docs, posting Slack notifications, kickoff approval workflows

#### New or Updated Document
Fires on both creations and any subsequent modifications:
- **Real-time monitoring** - Detects text edits, images, style changes, etc.
- **Enhanced payload** - Includes lastModifiedTime, lastModifyingUser information
- Ideal for change-log summaries, content sync to CMS, maintaining documentation repos

<Tip>
  Google push notifications are near-real-time (5-15 seconds). For large organizations, segment by folder to avoid hitting daily push quotas.
