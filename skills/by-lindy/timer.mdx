## Overview

Timer provides precise scheduling and delay capabilities for your Lindy workflows. Whether you need to run tasks on a recurring schedule, trigger at specific times, or add intelligent delays between actions, Timer gives you complete control over workflow timing.

<Note>
Timer is essential for creating time-based automations, scheduled reports, follow-up sequences, and any workflow requiring precise timing control.
</Note>

## Timer as a Trigger

</Frame>

Timer appears in the "Popular" triggers section, offering two powerful scheduling options:

</Frame>

### On Recurring Schedule

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-recurring-schedule-trigger.png" alt="Recurring schedule configuration with preset intervals and next run times [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Create workflows that run automatically on a repeating schedule. You can define any interval in natural languageâ€”just type what you want, like "every Monday to Friday at 8am."

<Tip>
The interface shows when each schedule will next run, helping you verify your timing is correct before activating.
</Tip>

### On Specific Time

<Frame>

</Frame>

Trigger workflows at an exact date and time.

**Configuration:**
- Visual calendar picker
- Precise time selection (hour/minute)
- AM/PM format
- Clear date display (mm/dd/yyyy)

## Timer as an Action

### Set Timer

Add intelligent delays to your workflows with flexible timing options.

Timer provides two essential actions for controlling workflow timing:

#### Wait Until Specific Time

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-until-actions.png" alt="Set Timer action configured to wait until a specific date and time [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Pause your workflow until an exact moment:
- Select specific date with calendar picker
- Choose precise time
- Workflow resumes automatically at the specified time

**Use cases:**
- Wait until business hours to send emails
- Delay actions until after an event
- Coordinate with external schedules

#### Wait For Duration

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-for-actions.png" alt="Set Timer action configured to wait for a specified number of minutes [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Add a relative delay to your workflow:
- Specify duration in minutes
- Simple numeric input
- Workflow continues after the delay

**Common durations:**
- 5 minutes - Brief pause between actions
- 60 minutes - Hourly intervals
- 1440 minutes - Daily delays
- Custom - Any duration you need

#### AI-Powered Timing

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-actions-ai-prompt.png" alt="Set Timer with Prompt AI mode for intelligent timing decisions [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Let AI determine the optimal wait time:
- Switch to "Prompt AI" mode
- Describe your timing needs in natural language
- AI calculates appropriate delays based on context

**Example prompts:**
- "Wait 2 hours after sending the initial email"
- "Delay until next business day at 9 AM"
- "Pause for the time specified in the response"

### Cancel Timers

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-cancel-timer-action.png" alt="Cancel Timers action to stop all active timers [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Stop all active timers in your workflow. This action cancels any pending timer delays and prevents queued actions from executing.

<Tip>
Canceling timers is especially useful for outbound sequences. If a recipient responds before a scheduled follow-up, you can use this action to cancel the timer and stop future messages from being sent.
</Tip>

## Managing Execution Paths

Both Timer triggers and actions show clear connection points:
- **After wait begins** - Continue parallel tasks
- **After wait elapsed** - Resume sequential flow

This enables sophisticated patterns like:
- Starting multiple timers simultaneously
- Running actions while waiting
- Coordinating complex timing sequences

<Tip>
This is a common mistake: If your timer isn't working as expected, make sure your next steps are connected to the `After wait elapsed` path.
</Tip>
