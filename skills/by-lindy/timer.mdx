## Overview

Timer provides precise scheduling and delay capabilities for your Lindy workflows. Whether you need to run tasks on a recurring schedule, trigger at specific times, or add intelligent delays between actions, Timer gives you complete control over workflow timing.

<Note>
Timer is essential for creating time-based automations, scheduled reports, follow-up sequences, and any workflow requiring precise timing control.
</Note>

## Timer as a Trigger

<Frame>

</Frame>

Timer appears in the "Popular" triggers section, offering two powerful scheduling options:

</Frame>

### On Recurring Schedule

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-recurring-schedule-trigger.png" alt="Recurring schedule configuration with preset intervals and next run times [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Create workflows that run automatically on a repeating schedule:

**Preset intervals:**
- Every hour
- Every hour on weekdays
- Every 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours
- Custom schedules (e.g., "Every Monday at 9am")

**Perfect for:**
- Daily reports
- Regular data syncs
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Recurring notifications

<Tip>
The interface shows when each schedule will next run, helping you verify your timing is correct before activating.
</Tip>

### On Specific Time

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-on-specific-time-trigger.png" alt="Specific time trigger with calendar date picker and time selector [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Trigger workflows at an exact date and time:

**Configuration:**
- Visual calendar picker
- Precise time selection (hour/minute)
- AM/PM format
- Clear date display (mm/dd/yyyy)

**Ideal for:**
- One-time events
- Deadline reminders
- Scheduled launches
- Time-sensitive notifications

## Timer as an Action

### Set Timer

Add intelligent delays to your workflows with flexible timing options.

</Frame>

Timer provides two essential actions for controlling workflow timing:

#### Wait Until Specific Time

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-until-actions.png" alt="Set Timer action configured to wait until a specific date and time [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Pause your workflow until an exact moment:
- Select specific date with calendar picker
- Choose precise time
- Workflow resumes automatically at the specified time

**Use cases:**
- Wait until business hours to send emails
- Delay actions until after an event
- Coordinate with external schedules

#### Wait For Duration

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-for-actions.png" alt="Set Timer action configured to wait for a specified number of minutes [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Add a relative delay to your workflow:
- Specify duration in minutes
- Simple numeric input
- Workflow continues after the delay

**Common durations:**
- 5 minutes - Brief pause between actions
- 60 minutes - Hourly intervals
- 1440 minutes - Daily delays
- Custom - Any duration you need

#### AI-Powered Timing

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-set-timer-actions-ai-prompt.png" alt="Set Timer with Prompt AI mode for intelligent timing decisions [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Let AI determine the optimal wait time:
- Switch to "Prompt AI" mode
- Describe your timing needs in natural language
- AI calculates appropriate delays based on context

**Example prompts:**
- "Wait 2 hours after sending the initial email"
- "Delay until next business day at 9 AM"
- "Pause for the time specified in the response"

### Cancel Timers

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-timer-cancel-timer-action.png" alt="Cancel Timers action to stop all active timers [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

Stop all active timers in your workflow:
- Cancels any pending timer delays
- Useful for conditional flow changes
- Prevents queued actions from executing

**When to use:**
- User responds before timer expires
- Conditions change requiring immediate action
- Error handling to stop scheduled tasks

## Workflow Continuity

Both Timer triggers and actions show clear connection points:
- **After wait begins** - Continue parallel tasks
- **After wait elapsed** - Resume sequential flow

This enables sophisticated patterns like:
- Starting multiple timers simultaneously
- Running actions while waiting
- Coordinating complex timing sequences

## Common Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Follow-Up Sequences">
    ```
    1. Send initial email
    2. Set Timer → For 3 days
    3. Check if replied (condition)
    4. If no reply → Send follow-up
    5. Set Timer → For 7 days
    6. Final follow-up or close
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Business Hours Scheduling">
    ```
    1. Receive request
    2. Check current time
    3. If outside hours → Set Timer → Until 9 AM
    4. Process request
    5. Send notification
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recurring Reports">
    ```
    Trigger: On Recurring Schedule → Every Monday 9 AM
    1. Gather data from last week
    2. Generate report
    3. Send to stakeholders
    4. Archive report
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deadline Management">
    ```
    1. Create task with deadline
    2. Set Timer → Until (deadline - 1 day)
    3. Send reminder
    4. Set Timer → Until deadline
    5. Escalate if not complete
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
