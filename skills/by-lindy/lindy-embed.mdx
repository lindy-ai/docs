## Customize Your Chatbot For Your Website

    style={{ borderRadius: '8px', border: '1px solid #E5E7EB' }}
  />
</Frame>

You'll see several options to customize your chatbot:

**Domain Name:** Restrict where your Lindy can be embedded. Leave it empty to use on any domain, or enter a specific domain like "yourcompany.com".

**Display Name:** Set the name of your bot as it will appear to users. For example, "Technical Interview Assistant" or "Customer Survey Bot".

**Accent Color:** Choose a color that matches your brand for the top of the chatbot window.

**Popup or iFrame:** Decide between a floating popup chatbot or a fixed iFrame embedded directly in your page.

**Logo:** Upload your company or project logo to appear in the top left of the expanded chatbot.

**Icon:** Select an icon for your chatbot's collapsed bubble.

**Greeting Message:** The introductory message the user sees when they start a chat.

**Conversation Starters:** Customize messages next to your bot to prompt engagement.

**Callout message:** Create a prompt to encourage users to interact with your chatbot.

## Embedding Lindy as an iFrame

You can also embed Lindy as an iFrame.

On the Configure Embed Settings modal, select the iFrame tab and copy the code snippet to your clipboard. You can then paste this code anywhere your website builder accepts iFrames.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <div className="video-card">
    <video
      src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy_export_embed_iframe.mp4"
      width="600"
      autoPlay
      muted
      loop
      playsInline
      style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', borderRadius: '16px' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

When embedding Lindy as an iFrame, it is important to set the height on the element containing the Embed iFrame.

You can also change the height property of the iFrame itself to a specific pixel value (e.g., 100px, 500px) instead of using "100%".

<Note>
  When using iFrame embedding, ensure your container element has a defined height. The iFrame will inherit the height of its container, so setting this correctly is crucial for proper display.
</Note>

## Testing Your Embed

Before deploying your Lindy Embed to production, it's essential to test the chatbot functionality and user experience.

### Preview Your Chatbot

Use the "Click here to preview your Lindy Embed and start a test conversation" link in the configuration panel to test your chatbot in a realistic environment. This allows you to:

- Verify the visual appearance matches your brand
- Test conversation flows and responses
- Check knowledge base integration
- Validate escalation workflows

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <div className="video-card">
    <video
      src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-emebed-testing-example.mp4"
      width="600"
      autoPlay
      muted
      loop
      playsInline
      style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', borderRadius: '16px' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Monitor Chatbot Conversations

<Frame>

Track user interactions and monitor conversation quality through the flow view. This helps you:

- Analyze user questions and interaction patterns
- Identify knowledge gaps or areas for improvement
- Monitor escalation triggers and response quality
- Optimize conversation starters and greeting messages

## Best Practices

- **Test on Multiple Devices**: Ensure your embed works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Match Your Brand**: Use your brand colors and logo for a cohesive experience
- **Clear Purpose**: Make the chatbot's purpose obvious through the display name and greeting
- **Domain Security**: Always specify allowed domains for production sites
- **Performance**: Monitor loading times and optimize as needed
