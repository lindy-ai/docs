## Overview

Lindy Meeting Recorder joins your meetings, records them, transcribes conversations, and sends you comprehensive notes with action items — all automatically.

## How It Works

The input is a virtual meeting link. When set to auto, it'll join automatically when any Google Meet or Zoom link is in its context. Below is how a Lindy with the `Meeting Recorder` is usually structured:

### 1. Calendar Event Trigger
- Activates before scheduled meetings
- Filters for specific meeting types (optional)

<Tip>
Typically used with this trigger to get calendar links for automatic meeting access.
</Tip>

### 2. Record Meeting Action
When it finds a virtual meeting link, your agent automatically joins and you'll see two execution paths:
- **After meeting starts:** Immediate actions during the meeting
- **After meeting ends:** Post-meeting processing with full transcript access

Your agent joins as "Lindy Meeting Notetaker" and records everything with real-time transcription.

### 3. Post-Meeting Actions
After the meeting ends, you can:
- Send a summary via Slack or email
- Set up an AI follow-up assistant to answer questions
- Save recordings and transcripts wherever you want
- Click into your task to view the recording and transcript

<Tip>
Use conditions to perform different actions depending on the type of meeting
</Tip>
