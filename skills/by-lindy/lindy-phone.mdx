## Overview

Lindy Phone transforms voice interactions into powerful automated workflows. Unlike traditional phone trees, Lindy Phone seamlessly connects to AI agents that can access your entire integration ecosystem - making API calls, searching the web, updating databases, and more - all during a live conversation.

<Note>
Every phone call in Lindy is automatically followed by an AI Agent node, enabling sophisticated tool integrations and dynamic responses based on the conversation.
</Note>

## How Lindy Phone Works

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-utilities-lindy-phone.png" alt="Phone call workflow showing call received trigger followed by AI agent node" />
</Frame>

This is how you interact with Lindy Phone:
1. **Phone trigger** (inbound) or **action** (outbound) initiates the call
2. **AI Agent node** automatically follows with phone agent skills. The prompt dictates the behavior, and you can optionally add other skills like:
   - Lindy integrations (Gmail, Slack, CRMs, etc.)
   - Web browsing and search capabilities
   - API connections
   - Database operations

This means your voice agent can work across your tech stack during conversations.

<Tip>
Pro tip: Use "After Call Ends" path to perform any logging or post-call actions instead of trying to do things during the live conversation.
</Tip>

## Setting Up Your AI-Powered Voice Agent

### Step 1: Configure the AI Agent

After adding your phone trigger/action, the AI agent node appears automatically. Your prompt is the instruction for the phone agent, as that's dictating the behavior on the phone.

**Essential configuration:**
- **Prompt**: Define your agent's personality, objectives, and conversation guidelines
- **Model**: We recommend Gemini Flash for simple calls and Claude Sonnet for complex conversations
- **Skills**: Add any Lindy action as a skill your agent can use

<Tip>
Pro tip: Start your prompt with clear role definition: "You are a [role] for [company]. Your goal is to [objective]."
</Tip>

### Step 2: Add Agent Skills

Your voice agent can perform any action available in Lindy:

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-phone-ai-agent-skills.png" alt="AI agent skills panel showing phone-specific actions and other integrations" />
</Frame>

**Phone-specific skills:**
- **End Call** - Gracefully terminate conversations
- **Press Numbers** - Navigate phone trees
- **Transfer Call** - Route to humans or departments

You can add any skills, but keep in mind that if Lindy uses non-phone skills it will increase latency and this is a conversation.
