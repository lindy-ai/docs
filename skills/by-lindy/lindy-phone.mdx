## Overview

Lindy Phone transforms voice interactions into powerful automated workflows. Unlike traditional IVR systems, Lindy Phone seamlessly connects to AI agents that can access your entire integration ecosystem - making API calls, searching the web, updating databases, and more - all during a live conversation.

<Note>
**Key insight:** Every phone call in Lindy is automatically followed by an AI Agent node, enabling sophisticated tool integrations and dynamic responses based on the conversation.
</Note>

## How Lindy Phone Works

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-utilities-lindy-phone.png" alt="Phone call workflow showing call received trigger followed by AI agent node [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

The magic happens through this workflow pattern:
1. **Phone trigger** (inbound) or **action** (outbound) initiates the call
2. **AI Agent node** automatically follows, providing access to:
   - All Lindy integrations (Gmail, Slack, CRMs, etc.)
   - Web browsing and search capabilities
   - API connections
   - Database operations
   - Custom code execution

This means your voice agent isn't just talking - it's actively working across your entire tech stack in real-time.

## Setting Up Your AI-Powered Voice Agent

### Step 1: Configure the AI Agent

After adding your phone trigger/action, the AI agent node appears automatically:

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lindy-phone-ai-agent-setup.png" alt="AI agent configuration showing prompt field and model selection [[memory:2619471]]" />
</Frame>

**Essential configuration:**
- **Prompt**: Define your agent's personality, objectives, and conversation guidelines
- **Model**: GPT-4o mini for simple flows, GPT-4 Turbo for complex conversations
- **Skills**: Add any Lindy action as a skill your agent can use

<Tip>
Pro tip: Start your prompt with clear role definition: "You are a [role] for [company]. Your goal is to [objective]."
</Tip>

### Step 2: Add Agent Skills

Your voice agent can perform any action available in Lindy:

</Frame>

**Phone-specific skills:**
- **End Call** - Gracefully terminate conversations
- **Press Numbers** - Navigate phone trees (IVR systems)
- **Transfer Call** - Route to humans or departments

**Power-user skills to add:**
- **Search Internet** - Look up information mid-call
- **HTTP Request** - Query APIs for real-time data
- **Update Spreadsheet** - Log call details instantly
- **Send Email/SMS** - Follow up automatically
- **Create Calendar Event** - Book appointments
- **Search Knowledge Base** - Access company information
