## Quick Overview

Lindy Mail gives your agent its own email address to send and receive emails independently. Perfect for CC'ing Lindy on threads, forwarding emails for action, or handling inbound emails directly.

Key benefits:
- **Dedicated inbox** - Lindy gets her own email address
- **Direct handling** - Emails go straight to Lindy, not your inbox
- **Thread awareness** - Lindy can observe and respond to follow-ups
- **Flexible triggers** - Filter which emails Lindy responds to

### Customizing Responses

Configure the "Body" field with detailed prompts to control how Lindy responds to emails. Well-crafted prompts ensure consistent, professional communication that reflects your brand voice and meets customer expectations.

**Best practices for email prompts:**
- Define the tone and personality Lindy should adopt
- Specify how to handle different types of inquiries
- Include escalation guidelines for complex issues
- Set clear expectations for response format and length

Example prompt:

```
Respond professionally and warmly to customer inquiries. 
Carefully read the entire email thread to understand context and previous interactions.
Address their specific questions with helpful, actionable information.
If you cannot fully resolve their issue, acknowledge their concern and provide clear next steps.
For urgent matters or complex technical issues, offer to escalate to a human team member.
Keep responses concise but thorough, and maintain a friendly, solution-oriented tone.
Sign off as "Lindy"
```

This approach ensures Lindy provides consistent, high-quality responses that build trust and effectively resolve customer needs while maintaining your organization's professional standards.


1. Copy Lindy's email address from your trigger
2. Send a test email to that address
3. Watch Lindy process and respond based on your instructions
