## Quick Overview

Lindy Mail gives your agent its own email address to send and receive emails independently. Perfect for CC'ing Lindy on threads, forwarding emails for action, or handling inbound emails directly.

Key benefits:
- **Dedicated inbox** - Lindy gets her own email address
- **Direct handling** - Emails go straight to Lindy, not your inbox
- **Thread awareness** - Lindy can observe and respond to follow-ups
- **Flexible triggers** - Filter which emails Lindy responds to

### Customizing Responses


Configure the "Body" field with your prompt to control how Lindy responds:

```
Respond professionally to customer inquiries. 
Address their specific questions and offer helpful next steps.
Sign off as "Lindy, Customer Success Team"
```


1. Copy Lindy's email address from your trigger
2. Send a test email to that address
3. Watch Lindy process and respond based on your instructions
