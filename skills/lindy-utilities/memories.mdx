## Overview

Memories let your agent learn and remember things forever - across all future tasks. Perfect for:

- **Self-improvement** - learn from mistakes and successes over time
- **Persistent knowledge** - remember important facts that apply to all tasks
- **Performance optimization** - build up expertise through experience
- **Error prevention** - avoid repeating the same mistakes

Unlike context (which only lasts during one task), memories persist across all task executions.

## Modify Lindy Memory Action

- **What it does**: Add, remove, or modify memories that your agent will remember across all future tasks.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Action**: Add, remove, or modify memory
- **Memory**: The text content of what to remember

### Outputs
- **Memory Status**: Confirmation of what was added, removed, or modified
- **Updated Memory**: The agent's memory bank is updated behind the scenes

<Tip>
Great at helping your agent learn from experience by adding snippets and rules over time that improve performance across all future tasks.
</Tip>

## Delete All Memories Action

- **What it does**: Completely wipes your agent's memory history - use when you need a fresh start.

## When to Use Memory Actions

### Add Memory
- Agent makes a mistake you want it to avoid next time
- Agent performs exceptionally well and you want to reinforce the behavior
- Important facts or preferences that apply to all tasks
- Process improvements discovered over time

### Clear Memories
- Starting fresh with a new agent configuration
- Memories have become outdated or conflicting
- Agent behavior has degraded due to accumulated memories
