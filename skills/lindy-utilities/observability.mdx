## Overview

Monitor and analyze agent performance with detailed task execution data. There are two key options for full observability into your agents:

- `Agent Task Change` trigger wakes up when another Lindy agent performs specific actions (errors, starts, finishes, etc.)
- `Get Task Details` action reads and analyzes everything an agent did during task execution, showing you block-by-block inputs, outputs, and performance data.

## Agent Task Change Trigger

- **What it does**: Triggers when another Lindy agent performs specific actions - perfect for monitoring agent activity and building reactive workflows.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Agent**: Select which agent you want to monitor
- **Events**: Multi-select from task states:
  - Task was created
  - Task succeeded
  - Task is working
  - Task was canceled
  - Task failed
- **Filter by subtask title**: Optional - monitor specific subtasks only

### Common Examples
- **Error Alerts**: Trigger on "Task failed" → Send email with failure details
- **Performance Tracking**: Trigger on "Task succeeded" → Log completion metrics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Trigger on "Task is working" → Send status updates

## Get Task Details

- **What it does**: Reads and analyzes everything an agent did during task execution. Shows you block-by-block inputs, outputs, and performance data for complete observability.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Agent**: Select the agent to analyze
- **Sub Task** (required): ID of the specific task/subtask to examine
- **Max Number of Blocks**: Recommended to set high - controls how much execution history to retrieve

<Tip>
Usually you want to use this action after an "Agent Task Change" trigger and you can leave the fields on "Auto" to pull in the correct agent & task ID.
</Tip>

### Outputs
- **Block-by-block execution**: Every action the agent performed
- **Inputs and outputs**: Exact data flowing through each step
- **Performance metrics**: Timing, success rates, error details
- **Task metadata**: Status, timestamps, execution context

### Common Examples
- **Error Analysis**: Get task details on failure → Analyze what went wrong → Send diagnostic report
- **Quality Evaluation**: Get task details after completion → Score performance → Log to spreadsheet
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze slow tasks → Identify bottlenecks → Optimize workflows

### Use Cases
- Build evaluation tools for agent quality
- Create automated debugging systems
- Track agent performance over time
- Generate detailed audit logs
- Feed execution data to AI for analysis and insights

## Working Together

These actions are designed to work together for complete agent observability:

  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/observability-together.png" alt="Observability workflow example" />
</Frame>

`Agent Task Change` triggers when something happens → `Get Task Details` analyzes exactly what occurred

This gives you full visibility into your agents - you'll know when they run, how they perform, and exactly what they do at every step.

## Advanced Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| Multi-Agent Monitoring | Track multiple agents from one observability workflow |
| Performance Benchmarking | Compare agent execution times and success rates over time |
| Error Pattern Analysis | Identify common failure points across different agents |
| Custom Alert Routing | Send different types of failures to different teams or channels |
| Quality Score Tracking | Build evaluation systems that score agent performance automatically |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the Right Events">
    Focus on the most actionable events - usually "Task Failed" for debugging and "Task Succeeded" for performance tracking.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set High Block Limits">
    For Get Task Details, set max blocks to a high number to capture complete execution history.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feed Data to AI">
    Use LLM Call to analyze task details - AI can spot patterns humans miss in execution data.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Build Evaluation Tools">
    Create systematic quality scoring by analyzing successful vs failed task patterns.
