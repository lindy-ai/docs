## Overview

Set Variables lets you store temporary data during task execution. Perfect for:

- **Temporary storage** - hold data that doesn't need to be in global context
- **Data passing** - share information between different parts of your workflow
- **Variable updates** - overwrite existing variables with new values
- **Clean organization** - keep your workflow organized with named references

Variables are scoped to the current task and automatically cleaned up when the task completes.

## Set Variable Action

- **What it does**: Creates or updates a variable that can be referenced throughout your current task execution.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Name**: The variable name that will be used for referencing (becomes the reference key)
- **Value**: The data to store - can be set manually, using prompts with context, or auto mode

### Outputs
- **Variable Reference**: The stored value can be referenced as an output in other actions
- **Updated Variable**: If using the same name, it overwrites the existing variable

<Tip>
Pro tip: Rename the Set Variable action to the actual variable name (like "Set Customer ID") for better organization when selecting output references from the menu.
</Tip>

## When to Use Variables

### Common Use Cases
- Store important data before clearing context
- Pass data between different workflow phases
- Keep track of counters, IDs, or status values
- Hold temporary calculations or processed results

### Variable Updates
- Use the same variable name to overwrite existing values
- Update variables as your workflow progresses
- Maintain state across different actions and conditions

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Naming">
    - Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification
    - Rename the action to match the variable name
    - Use consistent naming conventions across your workflow
    - Avoid generic names like "temp" or "data"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Variable Management">
    - Store essential data in variables before clearing context
    - Update variables rather than creating duplicates
    - Use variables for data that doesn't need global context access
    - Keep variable scope limited to what's actually needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workflow Organization">
    - Group related variables near each other in the workflow
    - Use descriptive action names for better output reference selection
    - Document complex variables with clear action names
    - Clean up unused variables by not referencing them
  </Accordion>
