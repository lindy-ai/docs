## Overview

Context management in Lindy gives you direct control over your agent's memory and attention. Perfect for:

- **Prioritizing important information** — anything you add to context gets favored in future decisions
- **Managing token costs** — clear context when it gets too large or expensive
- **Focusing agent attention** — remove distractions and highlight what matters
- **Advanced memory control** — combine with variables for sophisticated patterns

Context accrual happens automatically behind the scenes, but these actions give you more control.

## Add Context Action

- **What it does**: Explicitly adds important information to your agent's working memory, ensuring it's prioritized in all future decisions.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Contextt**: The information you want to add to context

### Outputs
- **Context Reference**: Can be referenced as an output in other actions
- **Updated Context**: The agent's context is updated behind the scenes
<Tip>
Lindy automatically manages context accrual for all actions. Anything you explicitly add to context gets prioritized and placed at the top — making it highly favored in the agent's decision-making process.
</Tip>

## Clear Task Context Action

- **What it does**: Removes all or selected context to reduce token usage and refocus your agent's attention on what matters most.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Message**: Instructions for what to preserve — like "preserve customer contacts or important information that will stay after the context is cleared"

### Outputs
- **Cleared Status**: Confirmation of what was removed
- **Remaining Context**: What context (if any) was preserved

<Tip>
Advanced Pattern: Before clearing context, save important information to variables. After clearing, add only the essential context back using those variables.
</Tip>

## When to Use Context Actions

### Add Context
Use when you need to prioritize information:
- Customer details when a call or conversation starts
- Critical findings that should influence all future decisions  
- Process state that other actions need to know about
- Error conditions that need to be tracked

### Clear Context
Use to manage costs and focus:
- When context gets large and expensive
- Switching between different workflow phases
- Processing multiple independent items
- Need to eliminate distractions

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Context Management">
    - Use variables to preserve essential data before clearing
    - Clear context at natural workflow breakpoints
    - Add context immediately after discovering critical information
    - Monitor context size in complex workflows
    - Use descriptive source labels for tracking
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token Cost Optimization">
    - Clear context when processing multiple similar items
    - Add only truly essential information to context
    - Use variables for temporary data that doesn't need global access
    - Monitor context accumulation in loops
    - Clear context before major workflow transitions
  </Accordion>
