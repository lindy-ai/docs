# Context

The Context utility allows you to manage and access contextual information throughout your Lindy workflows. It provides a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data that needs to be shared across different parts of your agent's execution.

## What is Context?

Context is a utility that provides a shared data store for your Lindy workflows. It allows you to store information that can be accessed by different actions, conditions, and utilities within the same task execution.

## Use Cases

- **Data Sharing**: Pass information between different actions in your workflow
- **State Management**: Maintain state across multiple steps
- **Configuration**: Store configuration data that can be accessed throughout the workflow
- **Temporary Storage**: Store intermediate results for later use

## How to Use Context

### Setting Context

```javascript
// Set a simple value
await setContext("userName", "John Doe");

// Set an object
await setContext("userProfile", {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  preferences: {
    language: "en",
    timezone: "UTC"
  }
});
```

### Getting Context

```javascript
// Get a specific value
const userName = await getContext("userName");

// Get an object
const userProfile = await getContext("userProfile");

// Get all context
const allContext = await getContext();
```

### Updating Context

```javascript
// Update existing context
await setContext("userProfile.preferences.language", "es");

// Merge with existing context
const currentProfile = await getContext("userProfile");
await setContext("userProfile", {
  ...currentProfile,
  lastLogin: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

## Context Lifecycle

- **Task Scope**: Context is available throughout the entire task execution
- **Persistence**: Context persists across different actions and conditions within the same task
- **Isolation**: Each task has its own isolated context
- **Cleanup**: Context is automatically cleaned up when the task completes

## Integration Examples

### With LLM Calls

```javascript
// Store user information in context
await setContext("userQuery", "How do I reset my password?");

// Use context in LLM call
const response = await llmCall({
  prompt: `User asked: ${await getContext("userQuery")}. 
           Provide a helpful response based on our knowledge base.`
});
```

### With Conditions

```javascript
// Check context to make decisions
const userType = await getContext("userType");
if (userType === "premium") {
  // Provide premium features
} else {
  // Provide basic features
}
```

### With Actions

```javascript
// Pass context to external actions
const userEmail = await getContext("userEmail");
await sendEmail({
  to: userEmail,
  subject: "Your request has been processed",
  body: "Thank you for your inquiry."
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names for context keys
- **Structure**: Organize related data into objects for better organization
- **Cleanup**: Don't store unnecessary data in context
- **Security**: Be careful not to store sensitive information in context
- **Performance**: Avoid storing large amounts of data in context

## Context vs Variables

- **Context**: Shared across the entire task execution
- **Variables**: Local to specific actions or conditions
- **Memory**: Persistent across multiple task executions

## Related Utilities

- **Set Variable**: Store local variables within actions
- **Memories**: Store persistent information across tasks
- **Get Task**: Access task-level information
