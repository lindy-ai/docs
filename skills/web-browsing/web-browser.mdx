## Overview

Web Browser actions provide direct access to internet search and webpage content extraction. Perfect for:

- **Internet search** - search Google and other search engines for information
- **Text extraction** - convert webpages and PDFs into readable text
- **Research workflows** - gather and process web content for analysis

## Search the Internet Action

- **What it does**: Searches the internet using your chosen search engine to find relevant results for your query.

### Inputs
- **Query**: The search terms or question you want to search for
- **Search Engine**: Choose your preferred search engine (Google is most common)

### Outputs
- **Search Results**: List of relevant websites and information found

This action becomes particularly powerful when used inside an AI agent, as the agent can formulate search queries based on context and process the results intelligently.

## Extract Webpage Text Action

- **What it does**: Converts webpages or PDFs into clean, readable text that can be processed by your agent.

### Inputs
- **URL**: The webpage or PDF URL you want to extract text from

### Outputs

- **Contact Details Scraper** - Extract contact information from websites
- **RAG Web Browser** - Advanced browsing for AI applications
