## Overview

Apify Actors are lightweight, containerized programs that automate tasks like web scraping, data processing, and workflows. Perfect for:

- **Web scraping** - extract data from websites using pre-built scrapers
- **Data processing** - transform and analyze data with specialized tools
- **Automation tasks** - run complex workflows with thousands of available Actors

[Apify offers 6,000+ pre-built Actors](https://apify.com/actors) that handle everything from social media scraping to data transformation, so you don't have to build scrapers from scratch.

## Run Actor Action

- **What it does**: Executes a selected Apify Actor with the specified configuration to perform web scraping, data processing, or other automated tasks.
