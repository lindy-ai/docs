## Quick Overview

Lindy's web browsing capabilities enable you to extract, monitor, and interact with web data at scale. From simple data scraping to complex multi-page workflows, Lindy provides powerful tools to automate web-based tasks while maintaining ethical standards and optimal performance.

Key benefits of web browsing with Lindy:
- **Intelligent extraction** - AI-powered data parsing and structure recognition
- **Ethical compliance** - Built-in respect for robots.txt and rate limiting
- **Multiple approaches** - Choose from browser automation, API integration, or specialized tools
- **Error resilience** - Automatic retries and fallback mechanisms
- **Scalable performance** - Handle single pages or massive data collection projects

## Web Data Extraction Methods

Lindy offers several approaches to web data extraction, each optimized for different use cases:

### 1. Web Browser Action

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/web-browse-action.png" alt="Web browser action configuration showing URL input and extraction settings" />
</Frame>

Perfect for dynamic content and JavaScript-heavy sites. The Web Browser action renders pages completely and can interact with elements just like a human user.

**Best for:**
- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Sites requiring user interaction
- Content loaded via JavaScript
- Taking screenshots or PDFs

### 2. Apify Integration

<Frame>

</Frame>

Leverage pre-built scrapers from the Apify ecosystem for common platforms like Amazon, LinkedIn, or Google Maps.

**Best for:**
- Popular websites with existing scrapers
- Large-scale data collection
- Complex extraction workflows
- Platform-specific optimizations



## Scraping Ethics and Legal Considerations


**Always Check Before Scraping:**
- **robots.txt** - Review the site's robots.txt file for scraping guidelines
- **Terms of Service** - Read and comply with website terms of use
- **Copyright laws** - Respect intellectual property and fair use principles
- **Data protection** - Follow GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **API availability** - Prefer official APIs when available

### Ethical Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respect Rate Limits">
    - Implement delays between requests (1-2 seconds minimum)
    - Monitor server response times and adjust accordingly
    - Use exponential backoff for retries
    - Never overwhelm servers with concurrent requests
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Identify Your Bot">
    - Use descriptive User-Agent strings
    - Include contact information when possible
    - Be transparent about your scraping purpose
    - Respond to takedown requests promptly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Minimization">
    - Extract only the data you actually need
    - Avoid scraping sensitive personal information
    - Implement data retention policies
    - Secure any collected data appropriately
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Server Courtesy">
    - Check robots.txt and honor directives
    - Scrape during off-peak hours when possible
    - Cache results to avoid repeat requests
    - Use compression to reduce bandwidth usage
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Web scraping laws vary by jurisdiction and can change rapidly. Always consult with legal experts for compliance guidance specific to your use case and location.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting Best Practices

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Fixed Delays** - Set consistent delays between requests
2. **Adaptive Throttling** - Adjust speed based on server response times
3. **Concurrent Limits** - Restrict simultaneous connections
4. **Retry Logic** - Handle temporary failures gracefully

### Rate Limiting Configuration

```python
import time
import random

def respectful_request(url, min_delay=1, max_delay=3):
    # Random delay to appear more human-like
    delay = random.uniform(min_delay, max_delay)
    time.sleep(delay)
    
    # Add jitter to avoid synchronized requests
    jitter = random.uniform(0.1, 0.5)
    time.sleep(jitter)
    
    return requests.get(url)
```

<Tip>
Start with conservative rate limits (1-2 seconds between requests) and gradually optimize based on the target site's response and your specific needs.
</Tip>



## Performance Optimization

**Optimization Techniques:**

1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache frequently accessed pages
   - Implement intelligent cache invalidation
   - Use CDN endpoints when available

2. **Resource Management**
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets
   - Stream process large files
   - Clean up temporary resources

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Split work across multiple agents
   - Use thread pools for I/O operations
   - Implement queue-based processing
