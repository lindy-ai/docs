    - Include industry or domain context for better results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Model Selection Strategy">
    - Start with lower-tier models for simple queries
    - Use Deep Research for comprehensive analysis
    - Consider cost vs. thoroughness trade-offs
    - Use Reasoning models when you need logical connections
    - Scale model choice to query complexity
