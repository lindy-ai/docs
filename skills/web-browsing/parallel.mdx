## Overview

Parallel provides powerful web browsing and data enrichment capabilities for your agents. Perfect for:

- **Web research** - ask questions and get answers from web content
- **Data enrichment** - automatically enhance your data with web information
- **Entity research** - gather detailed information about companies, people, or topics

## Chat with Web Action

- **What it does**: Ask questions and get answers by browsing and analyzing web content in real-time.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Question**: The query or question you want answered
- **Processor**: Choose the model strength for your research needs

### Outputs
- **Response**: The response based on web research

## Web Enrichment Action

- **What it does**: Enriches your data by automatically gathering additional information about entities from the web.

</Frame>

### Inputs
- **Entity**: The thing you want to enrich (company name, person, topic, etc.)
- **Enrichment Columns**: Choose automatic enrichment or specify custom columns
- **Processor**: Choose the model strength for processing

### Example Enrichment Columns

| Entity Type | Common Columns |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Companies** | Industry, Employee Count, Revenue, Website, Headquarters, Founded Year |
| **People** | Job Title, Company, LinkedIn Profile, Education, Location |
| **General Entities** | Description, Category, Related Links, Key Facts |

### Outputs
- **Enriched Data**: Enhanced information about your entity

## Processor Selection

Both actions use the same processor options:

| Processor | Description | Strength |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Lite** | Basic web browsing and research | ⭐ |
| **Base** | Standard processing with better analysis | ⭐⭐ |
| **Core** | Enhanced capabilities for complex tasks | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Pro** | Advanced processing with detailed results | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Ultra** | Maximum capability for thorough research | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

<Tip>
Core processor provides good balance of speed and detail for most research tasks.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Question Optimization">
    - Be specific about what information you need
    - Include context when asking about entities
    - Use clear, direct questions for better results
    - Specify timeframes when relevant
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enrichment Strategy">
    - Start with automatic enrichment to see available data
    - Use specific columns when you know what you need
    - Choose appropriate processor based on entity complexity
    - Test with sample entities before processing large datasets
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limit Management">
    - When looping, set concurrency limits to prevent hitting rate limits
    - Reduce parallel requests when processing large datasets
    - Monitor for timeout errors and adjust concurrency accordingly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
