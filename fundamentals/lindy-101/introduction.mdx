## Welcome to Lindy

Lindy is an AI agent platform that helps you automate complex workflows by connecting AI agents to your tools and data. Think of Lindy as your AI teammate that can handle tasks across your entire tech stack.

## Core Concepts

Lindy is built around a few key concepts that work together:

### **Lindy**
Lindy orchestrates all your agents and workflows. It understands what you need and helps you build, manage, and run the right agents for your work.

### **Agents**
Individual workers that understand context, make decisions, and execute actions. You configure agents to follow specific workflows.

### **Workflows**
Configured in the flow editor to define the specific steps your agent takes. Agents can have multiple workflow steps.

### **Steps**
Individual building blocks that make up a workflow. There are many different types of steps, such as:
- **[Triggers](/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers)**: Decide when an agent wakes up and starts working
- **[Actions](/fundamentals/lindy-101/actions)**: The steps an agent takes in response to a trigger
- **[Agent Steps](/fundamentals/lindy-101/ai-agents)**: Give agents more autonomy to handle uncertain tasks with skill-based execution
- **[Integrations](/skills/popular-integrations)**: Connect your agent to external systems and tools
- **[Conditions](/fundamentals/lindy-101/conditions)**: Define logic for when agents should take certain actions

### **Memory**
You can configure agents to remember conversations and context, making them more helpful over time.
