## Welcome to Lindy

Lindy is an AI agent platform that helps you automate complex workflows by connecting AI agents to your tools and data. Think of Lindy as your AI teammate that can handle tasks across your entire tech stack.

## Core Concepts

Lindy is built around a few key concepts that work together:

### ðŸ¤– **AI Agents**
AI agents are the brains of your automation. They can understand context, make decisions, and execute actions. Learn how to [create and configure agents](/building-agents/agent-basics/creating-agents) to handle your specific use cases.

### ðŸ”„ **Workflows**
Workflows connect your agents to triggers and actions. They define what happens when, from simple email responses to complex multi-step processes. Start with [triggers](/fundamentals/lindy-101/triggers) and [actions](/fundamentals/lindy-101/actions).

### ðŸ§  **Memory & Context**
Lindy agents remember conversations and context, making them more helpful over time. Explore [memory](/fundamentals/lindy-101/memory) and [knowledge bases](/fundamentals/lindy-101/knowledge-base) to give your agents superpowers.

### ðŸ”— **Integrations**
Connect Lindy to your existing tools through [integrations](/integrations/overview). From Gmail and Slack to Notion and Salesforce, Lindy works with the tools you already use.
