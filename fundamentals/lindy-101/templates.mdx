## What are Templates?

Templates are pre-built Lindy workflows that you can use as starting points for your own automations. They provide a foundation with common patterns, integrations, and logic that you can customize for your specific needs.

Templates help you:
- **Get started quickly** - Skip the initial setup and configuration
- **Learn best practices** - See how experienced builders structure their workflows
- **Save time** - Build on proven patterns instead of starting from scratch
- **Share knowledge** - Distribute your workflows to help others
