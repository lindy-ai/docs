## Types of Voice Agents

### Inbound Call Handling
Uses the "Call Received" trigger to answer incoming calls automatically.

**Best for:**
- Customer support automation
- Booking and scheduling
- Lead qualification
- After-hours answering

**Available actions:**
- End call
- Transfer call
- Press numbers (phone tree navigation)

### Outbound Call Campaigns  
Uses the "Make Phone Call" action to initiate calls.

**Best for:**
- Sales outreach

- Survey collection
- Follow-up campaigns

<Tip>
We recommend using Gemini Flash for simple phone actions or simple phone calls, and Claude Sonnet for more advanced phone behavior. These recommendations may change as new models emerge.

Add transfer capability to AI agents:

1. In your agent prompt, include transfer instructions:

   If the customer asks for a human or you determine transfer is needed, 
   transfer to: +1-555-0123
   ```
2. Add **Transfer Call** as an agent skill
3. Agent will intelligently decide when to transfer

<Tip>
Add conditions before transfers to route calls based on area code, time of day, or conversation content.
