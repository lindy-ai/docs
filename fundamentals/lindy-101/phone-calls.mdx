## Types of Voice Agents

### Inbound Call Handling
Uses the "Call Received" trigger to answer incoming calls automatically.

**Best for:**
- Customer support automation
- Booking and scheduling
- Lead qualification
- After-hours answering

**Available actions:**
- End call
- Transfer call
- Press numbers (phone tree navigation)

### Outbound Call Campaigns  
Uses the "Make Phone Call" action to initiate calls.

**Best for:**
- Sales outreach
- Appointment reminders
- Survey collection
- Follow-up campaigns

<Tip>
Currently, we recommend using GPT-4o mini for phone actions inside AI agent nodes and GPT-4 Turbo for standalone phone workflows. These recommendations may change as new models emerge.

Add transfer capability to AI agents:

1. In your agent prompt, include transfer instructions:
   ```
   If the customer asks for a human or you determine transfer is needed, 
   transfer to: +1-555-0123
   ```
2. Add **Transfer Call** as an agent skill
3. Agent will intelligently decide when to transfer

<Tip>
Add conditions before transfers to route calls based on area code, time of day, or conversation content.
