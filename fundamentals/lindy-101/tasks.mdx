## Quick Overview

Tasks are your mission control center for monitoring all of your agent's activities. When you click the Tasks button in your Lindy interface, you're accessing the Task History or Tasks View â€” a real-time dashboard that shows every single workflow execution (called a "task") that your agent has performed.

## How to access Tasks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Tasks button">
    Click the "Tasks" button to access your Task History view

### Example task monitoring
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <div className="video-card">
    <video
      src="/lindy-brand-assets/tasks_5.mp4"
      width="600"
      autoPlay
      muted
      loop
      playsInline
      style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', borderRadius: '16px' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Click on any individual task to see:
- Subtasks if looping was used in the workflow
- Every single step your Lindy executed in that workflow
- The exact order of operations
- Input and output data for each step
- Timestamps showing when each step was completed
- Any decisions or conditions your Lindy evaluated

### Error detection and troubleshooting
<Frame>

</Frame>
Quickly identify and resolve issues with:
- Exact error location and failure reasons
- Detailed error messages and debugging information

<Tip>
  Use the Tasks view alongside Test Mode in the Flow Editor to compare expected vs. actual results and iterate on your workflows.
</Tip>

## What you can see in real-time

### Live execution tracking
Monitor your workflows as they happen:
- Watch each step execute in real-time
- See which step is currently running
- Track progress through complex workflows
- Monitor overall task completion times

### Data flow visibility
See exactly how information moves through your workflow:
- Data being passed between steps
- API responses and extracted information
- How information transforms as it moves through your workflow
- Processed results and final outputs

## Task monitoring benefits

### Proactive problem solving
Stay ahead of issues with:
- Immediate error detection and notifications
- Email alerts when errors occur
- Detailed error information for quick fixes
- Prevention of workflow failures
