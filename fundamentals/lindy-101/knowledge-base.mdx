# Knowledge Base

Knowledge bases are repositories of data that your AI agents can search through to retrieve relevant information. They provide your agents with long-term memory and context, enabling them to make more informed decisions and provide better responses.

## What is a Knowledge Base?

A knowledge base is a collection of documents, data, or information that your AI agent can access and search through. When your agent needs to answer questions or make decisions, it can search the knowledge base to find relevant information.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Search**: Agents search through knowledge bases semantically, finding results whose meaning is similar to the query
- **Long-term Memory**: Store information that persists across conversations and sessions
- **Context Enhancement**: Provide agents with background information and domain-specific knowledge
- **Multiple Sources**: Import data from various sources including websites, documents, and databases

## Creating a Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to the Knowledge Base section in your Lindy dashboard
2. Click "Create New Knowledge Base"
3. Give your knowledge base a name and description
4. Choose how you want to add content:
   - **Website URLs**: Add web pages to scrape and index
   - **File Upload**: Upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
   - **Manual Entry**: Add content directly through the interface

## Using Knowledge Bases in Agents

Once you've created a knowledge base, you can reference it in your agent's prompts and actions:

```
You are a customer support agent. Use the knowledge base "Product Documentation" 
to answer customer questions about our products and services.
```

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Updated**: Regularly update your knowledge base with new information
- **Organize Content**: Use clear titles and descriptions for better searchability
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on high-quality, relevant content
- **Test Regularly**: Verify that your agents can find the information they need

## Integration with Other Features

Knowledge bases work seamlessly with other Lindy features:
- **Conditions**: Use knowledge base searches to make decisions
- **Actions**: Reference knowledge base content in responses
- **Memory**: Combine with agent memory for comprehensive context
