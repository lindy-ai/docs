## Quick Overview

Conditions let you create branching logic in your Lindy workflows. They evaluate specific criteria and direct your agent down different paths based on the results. Think of them as "if-then" statements that make your automations smarter and more responsive to different scenarios.

Key benefits of using conditions:
- **Smart routing** - Direct workflows down different paths based on content, context, or criteria
- **Dynamic responses** - Handle multiple scenarios within a single workflow
- **Intelligent filtering** - Process only relevant items or data that meet specific requirements
- **Automated decision-making** - Let your agent choose the best action without manual intervention
- **Workflow efficiency** - Avoid unnecessary steps by branching only when conditions are met


## Creating Your First Condition

To add a condition to your workflow, click the plus button (Add step) below any action or between two actions, then select "Condition".

</Frame>

### Setting Up the Condition

Once you've added a condition, you'll see the condition configuration panel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/conditions_initial.png" alt="Initial condition setup" />
</Frame>

Every condition prompt starts with **"Go down this path if..."** followed by your criteria. For example:
- `the email received was asking a question and needs a response`
- `the email contains a 6 digit user ID number`
- `the user asked for a refund or seems angry`

### Adding Multiple Condition Paths

You can create multiple branches to handle different scenarios. Click "+ Add Condition" to create alternate paths.

  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/condition_2_add_alternate_path.png" alt="Adding alternate condition paths" />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Each condition branch should have a clear, distinct criteria. Lindy will evaluate all conditions and follow the first matching path.
</Note>

## Advanced Configuration

### Force Agent to Select a Branch

By default, if no conditions are met, Lindy will stop the task. You can change this behavior by enabling "Force the agent to select a branch".

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/force_agent_to_select_branch.png" alt="Force agent to select branch option" />
</Frame>

When enabled, Lindy must choose one of the defined paths even if none of the conditions perfectly match. This is useful when you want to ensure the workflow always continues.

### Renaming Conditions

For better organization, especially in complex workflows, rename your conditions with descriptive titles.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/rename_condition.png" alt="Renaming a condition" />
</Frame>

Click on the condition title (e.g., "Condition 1") and replace it with a meaningful name like "Found a response" or "Customer is angry".


## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Write Clear, Specific Prompts">
    Be explicit about what you're looking for. Instead of "important email", use "email from a C-level executive or marked as high priority".
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Edge Cases">
    Consider what happens when conditions overlap or when none match. Use the test panel to verify behavior.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Order Matters">
    Lindy evaluates conditions in order and takes the first matching path. Place more specific conditions before general ones.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add Examples">
    Include examples in your condition prompts to improve accuracy: "the email asks about pricing (e.g., 'how much does it cost', 'what are your rates')".
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


<Tip>
  For conditions that require understanding context, sentiment, or complex logic, use more advanced models. For simple keyword matching or basic categorization, faster models work well.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting
#### Common Issues

1. **Workflow stops when no conditions match**
   - Enable "Force agent to select branch" or add a catch-all condition

2. **Wrong path is chosen**
   - Review and refine your condition prompts
   - Check the order of conditions
   - Add more specific examples

3. **Conditions overlap**
   - Make each condition mutually exclusive
   - Order from most specific to least specific

<Warning>
  If your workflow stops unexpectedly, check that each condition branch has at least one action following it. Empty branches will cause the execution to end.
</Warning>
