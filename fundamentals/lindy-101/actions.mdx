## Quick Overview

Actions are the building blocks of your Lindy workflows - specific operations that your AI agent can perform to complete tasks. From sending emails and creating calendar events to complex data processing and multi-step reasoning, actions transform your Lindy from a simple chatbot into a powerful automation engine.
A single workflow can contain multiple actions that execute sequentially or in parallel, creating sophisticated automations that handle everything from customer support to lead qualification.

## Key benefits of using actions:

- Automated task execution – Perform complex operations without manual intervention
- Seamless integrations – Connect with hundreds of third-party applications
- AI-powered intelligence – Adapt behavior based on context and data
- Scalable operations – Handle single tasks or process thousands of items in parallel
- Reliable workflows – Constrained AI ensures predictable, business-ready automation


## How to add an action
<Steps>

## Types of actions

### Basic actions
Basic actions provide straightforward, single-purpose operations that are quick to set up and easy to use. They consume fewer credits (minimum 1 credit per task) and are perfect for common automation tasks. These actions still use AI and integrations but focus on simpler, more direct operations. Examples include:
- Send Email
- Create Calendar Event
- Update Spreadsheet
- Send Slack Message
### Complex actions

AI Agent actions offer more powerful capabilities with complex reasoning and adaptive behavior. These actions can continue "looping" until exit conditions are met and adapt to context dynamically. They consume more credits but provide sophisticated decision-making for multi-step processes.
### Stateful actions
<Frame>

</Frame>
Stateful actions create persistent contexts that can both execute operations and listen for future events. They show different execution paths that you can choose from based on your workflow needs.

**How stateful actions work:**
- **Choose your paths**: Select which execution paths you need - you can choose one or both
- **Execute normally**: "After email sent" path continues your workflow immediately after sending
- **Listen for events**: "After reply received" path adds listening capability to wake up your agent when replies arrive
- **Maintain context**: When the agent wakes up from listening, it has full context of the original interaction

**Key example: Email Actions**
- Send an email and choose your paths
- "After email sent" → workflow continues normally  
- "After reply received" → agent listens and wakes up when replies arrive with full thread context
- You'll see linked actions available in your action selector for stateful operations

This enables reactive workflows where agents can handle both proactive tasks and responsive interactions seamlessly.

### Multi-threaded actions
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/actions_5.png" alt="Stateful actions workflow example" />
</Frame>
Multi-threaded actions occur when you have multiple stateful actions running simultaneously, each maintaining their own conversation threads and contexts.

**How multi-threading works:**
- **Multiple conversations**: If you send two emails that are both stateful, you now have two separate listening threads
- **Thread selection**: When responding, you must choose which specific conversation thread you're replying to
- **Independent contexts**: Each thread maintains its own state and conversation history
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple stateful actions can listen and respond independently

**Example scenario:**
- Send Email A to Customer 1 (stateful)
- Send Email B to Customer 2 (stateful)  
- Both customers reply
- Agent wakes up twice with separate contexts
- Each response is handled within its specific conversation thread

This enables sophisticated multi-conversation management where a single agent can handle numerous ongoing interactions simultaneously.


## Action configuration
Every action in Lindy offers several configuration options to customize its behavior and ensure it works perfectly within your workflow.
### Account selection
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/actions_7.png" alt="Account selection interface" />
</Frame>
Choose which connected account the action should use. If you authorize your company Gmail account, Lindy will only access your company email. You can authorize multiple accounts for a given application, but each action will only use one account.
### Model selection
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/actions_8.png" alt="Model selection interface" />
</Frame>
Select the AI model to be used for the action. The model completes the parameters using context from the workflow and data from prior steps. Bigger models are smarter but more expensive - Lindy provides top AI models ready to use out of the box.

## Best practices
<Tip>
  Start with simple actions and gradually add complexity. Test each action individually before building complex workflows.
</Tip>

### Optimization strategies
- **Model Selection**: Begin with powerful models to get workflows right, then optimize costs by switching to smaller models once workflows are proven
- **Credit Management**: Basic automations use 1 credit minimum while complex tasks consume more. Use "Set Manually" mode for direct data transfer to reduce credit consumption
- **Error Prevention**: Test workflows thoroughly and set up proper error notifications

### Security considerations
- **Data Protection**: All actions use encryption at rest and in transit, with account isolation and granular permission management
- **Access Control**: Each action only accesses the specific accounts you authorize, with secure OAuth authentication
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all action executions provides full visibility into what your Lindy is doing
