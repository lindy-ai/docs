## Quick Overview

Triggers are events that "wake up" a Lindy and start a workflow. These can include time-based triggers (e.g., every weekday at 9 am), chat-based triggers (when a user starts a new chat), or event-based triggers (e.g., when you receive an email).

A single Lindy can have multiple triggers, either managing different workflows or acting as entry points into the same workflow.

Key benefits of using triggers:
- **Automated kickoff** – Start workflows the moment something important happens
- **Flexible scheduling** – Run tasks at specific times or on recurring schedules
- **Real-time responsiveness** – React instantly to new emails, calendar events, webhooks, and more
- **Multi-entry workflows** – Allow several different triggers to feed into the same automation
- **Hands-free operations** – Eliminate manual starts and speed up processes

## Types of triggers

### Time-based triggers
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_3.png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>
Starts the workflow at a set or recurring time. Examples include:
- Every weekday at 9 AM
- Daily at midnight
- Weekly on Monday
- Monthly on the 1st


### Chat-based triggers
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_4.png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>
Starts the workflow when a user initiates a chat. This allows users to interact directly with your Lindy through the chat interface.

### Event-based triggers
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_16
  .png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>
Starts the workflow when a specific event occurs. Examples include:
- Slack message received
- Email received
- Calendar event started
- New row added to Google Sheets
- Webhook received

## How to add a trigger

<Steps>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your trigger">
    Click "Select Trigger" and search for a tool or trigger that will initiate a response from Lindy

## Trigger filters

A trigger filter allows you to set conditional logic to filter which events will cause Lindy to wake up and execute the workflow.

You can enable trigger filters at the bottom of the trigger configuration settings. This means you do not have to add additional steps to filter out triggering events from your workflow.


### Example: Calendar trigger setup
If you want Lindy to join your interview calls, select the Calendar Event Started trigger. This will wake Lindy up when a calendar event starts, assuming there is a meeting on your calendar.

<Tip>
  Use triggers together with <strong>conditions</strong> to route workflows intelligently based on context.
</Tip>

### Filter rules
- Trigger filters are not case-sensitive
- You can add multiple filter conditions and combine them with AND or OR conditions
- Condition Groups allow you to build more complex, nested filtering logic

### Example filter
In the example below, Lindy will only trigger if:
- The Calendar Event name contains "Interview" AND the location contains "1841 Market Street"
- OR the Calendar Event description contains "In-Person Interview"

### Minutes offset
<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_10.png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>
Some triggers, such as the Calendar Event Started trigger, offer a Minutes Offset, which allows the trigger timing to begin before or after the event start time:
- A negative Minutes Offset (-) sets the trigger before the event start time
- A positive Minutes Offset (+) sets the trigger after the event start time

For example, if you wanted a Meeting Prep Lindy to prep you 30 minutes before a meeting, you would set the Minutes Offset to -30. In this case, the workflow would begin 30 minutes before the Calendar Event Start time.

## Multiple triggers

One Lindy can have multiple triggers, either initiating the same workflow or triggering entirely different ones.

### Multiple triggers for the same workflow

For example, if you receive lead emails from a contact@company.com email address and also have a form on your website that sends leads to a Google Sheet, you can configure two triggers to aggregate your leads:

1. One trigger would be on an Email Received
2. The other would be on a New Row Added to a Google Sheet

The workflow would execute exactly the same for both triggers.

#### How to set up multiple triggers

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_13.png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>

1. Create your first trigger and workflow
2. Click "New Trigger" in the top left of the Flow Editor
3. Add your second trigger
4. Drag the grey arrow beneath the second trigger and connect it to the appropriate step in your existing workflow

### A Lindy with multiple workflows

Under some circumstances, you may want your Lindy to have two distinct workflows. For example, let's say you want to build a Meeting Notetaker Lindy that can also answer meeting questions in the Lindy app:

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/Triggers_15.png" alt="Calendar + Chat multi-trigger workflow" />
</Frame>

1. **First Workflow:** Meeting recorder that joins your meeting, creates a Google Document with meeting notes and saves them in a Folder (triggered by Calendar Event Start)

2. **Second Workflow:** Answer meeting questions with a Message Received trigger. This workflow begins when a user sends a message to Lindy, searches the knowledge base (which queries all the Documents in the Folder created by the first workflow), and then responds to the user.

This example outlines two workflows with different triggers:
- One workflow joins your meetings and takes notes
- The other allows the user to chat with their meetings and get instant answers to questions about their meetings
