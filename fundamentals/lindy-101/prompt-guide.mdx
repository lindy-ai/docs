## Where to Prompt in Lindy

Lindy provides three key areas where you can add prompts, each serving a specific purpose in your automation workflow.

### 1. Agent-Level Settings

These are overarching instructions that Lindy keeps in mind throughout the entire automation process. They're added as a prefix to every LLM call made by this agent.

```
You are an AI assistant for a marketing agency. Always maintain 
a professional tone and focus on marketing-related tasks.
```

<Tip>
  Agent-level prompts are perfect for setting personality, tone, domain expertise, and consistent behavior patterns across all actions.
</Tip>

### 2. Action Parameters

Specific instructions for completing particular fields within actions. These provide precise control over individual steps in your workflow.

<Frame>

</Frame>

```
Extract the customer's name and email address from the following text, 
formatting them as 'Name: [name], Email: [email]'
```

### 3. AI Agent Actions

When next steps are uncertain or highly variable, AI Agents use broad guidelines and skills to determine the best course of action.

```
You are a customer service agent. Your goal is to resolve customer 
inquiries efficiently while maintaining a friendly tone. Choose the 
appropriate skill based on the customer's needs.
```


## Core Prompting Principles

### Be Direct and Specific

Skip pleasantries and ambiguous language. Lindy executes direct commands most effectively.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Ineffective">
    ```
    Could you please try to find the customer's email address 
    somewhere in the message if possible?
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Effective">
    ```
    Extract the customer email address from the message body.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Action-Oriented Language

Prefer imperative verbs ("do") over passive suggestions ("don't").

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Passive">
    ```
    The response shouldn't be too long and try not to include 
    technical jargon that might confuse the customer.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Active">
    ```
    Write a concise response under 100 words. Use simple, 
    non-technical language.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Define Clear Personas

Give Lindy a clear role and expertise level for consistent responses.

```
You are an expert B2B sales professional with 10 years of experience 
in SaaS. Craft compelling follow-up emails that include a strong hook 
and clear call-to-action (CTA). All communication should be 
conversational yet professional.
```

### Step-by-Step Instructions

Break down complex tasks into simple, sequential steps, guiding Lindy through each part of the process.

```
1. Analyze the webpage text
2. Identify all open job openings
3. Qualify the job openings, selecting only those that are remote positions
4. Format the results as a bulleted list with job title and location
```


## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)

Guide Lindy through complex reasoning by breaking down the thinking process.

```
Analyze this support ticket step by step:
1. First, identify the customer's primary issue
2. Then, check if it matches any known problems in our knowledge base
3. If yes, provide the solution. If no, escalate to human support
4. Finally, categorize the ticket type for reporting
```

### 2. Few-Shot Examples

Provide examples to demonstrate the exact format and style you want.

```
Categorize emails using these examples:

Email: "Your invoice is attached" → Category: Billing
Email: "How do I reset my password?" → Category: Support
Email: "Interested in enterprise pricing" → Category: Sales

Now categorize this email: {{email_body}}
```

### 3. Output Formatting

Specify exact output structure for consistent, parseable results.

```
Format your response as JSON:
{
  "customer_name": "[extracted name]",
  "sentiment": "[positive/negative/neutral]",
  "priority": "[high/medium/low]",
  "summary": "[one sentence summary]"
}
```

### 4. Constraints and Boundaries

Set clear limits to prevent unwanted behaviors.

```
Reply to customer inquiries following these rules:
- Maximum 150 words per response
- Never share internal pricing calculations
- Only discuss products listed in the knowledge base
- If asked about competitors, redirect to our strengths
- Always include one relevant help article link
```

### 5. Context Injection

Reference available data and previous interactions.

```
Using the customer's purchase history from {{hubspot_contact_data}} 
and their last 3 support tickets, personalize your response to 
acknowledge their loyalty and address their specific product usage.
```

### 6. Conditional Logic

Build prompts that adapt based on input conditions.

```
If the email sentiment is negative:
  - Start with an empathy statement
  - Offer immediate assistance
  - Escalate to supervisor if requested

If the email sentiment is positive:
  - Thank them for their feedback
  - Ask for a review or testimonial
  - Suggest relevant add-on products
```

### 7. Error Handling

Anticipate edge cases and provide fallback instructions.

```
Extract the order number from the email.

If no order number is found:
- Check for alternative identifiers (invoice #, reference #)
- If still not found, ask the customer to provide it
- Log this as "missing_order_number" for follow-up
```


## Essential Prompting Elements

### Keywords and Phrases

Incorporate essential words to emphasize important aspects and priorities:

- "Your task is..."
- "You MUST..."
- "It is crucial that..."
- "You will be penalized if..."

### Use Delimiters Effectively

Delimiters organize information and reduce ambiguity:

- Triple quotes: `"""example text"""`
- Triple backticks: ` ```example text``` `
- Triple dashes: `---example text---`
- XML-like tags: `<example>example text</example>`
- Hashtags: `###example text###`

**Example using XML tags:**

```
<role>You are a customer service representative for a tech company.</role>

<task>Respond to customer inquiries about product features.</task>

<context>{{email_body}}</context>

<response_format>
- Be friendly and professional
- Include specific pricing details
- Offer to help with setup if needed
</response_format>
```

### Consistency is Key

Instruct Lindy to maintain the flow and style of writing from previous steps in the workflow or examples you have added to the prompt. This ensures a cohesive output across the entire process.

### Clear Formatting

Separate instructions with line breaks for clarity. This visual organization helps Lindy process information more effectively.

```
First instruction here.

Second instruction here.

Third instruction here.
```

### Enhance Specificity

Provide complete information for tasks that require detailed responses or actions. Context is crucial for accurate results.

```
When responding to customer support tickets, consider:
- Customer tier (Free/Pro/Enterprise)
- Previous support history
- Product features they have access to
- Time zone and business hours
```

### Edit for Clarity

Every word matters! Proofread your prompts for grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary to ensure they are clear and consistent. Ambiguity can lead to unexpected results.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Ambiguous">
    ```
    Process the data and send it to the right place based on what 
    type it is and who needs it
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Clear">
    ```
    Categorize incoming data by type (sales/support/billing). 
    Route sales data to CRM, support tickets to helpdesk, and 
    billing queries to finance team.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Common Patterns

- **Conditions**: If-then scenarios


## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with simple prompts and iterate">
    Begin with basic instructions and add complexity as you test. Monitor agent behavior and refine based on actual outputs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent terminology">
    Define key terms once and use them consistently. If you call it "customer" in one place, don't switch to "client" elsewhere.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with edge cases">
    Try unusual inputs, empty fields, and unexpected formats. Build prompts that handle these gracefully.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Leverage available context">
    Reference trigger data, previous actions, and knowledge base content. The more context, the better the response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version and document changes">
    Keep track of prompt iterations and why changes were made. This helps troubleshooting and team collaboration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Balance specificity with flexibility">
    Be specific enough to get consistent results but flexible enough to handle variations in input.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent provides inconsistent responses">
    - Add more specific examples
    - Define clearer boundaries and constraints
    - Check for conflicting instructions between agent-level and action-level prompts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Output format varies">
    - Use structured formats (JSON, markdown)
    - Provide exact templates to follow
    - Add validation rules for critical fields
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent misses important information">
    - Make extraction instructions more explicit
    - Add fallback searches for alternative formats
    - Use step-by-step extraction logic
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Responses are too verbose or too brief">
    - Set specific word/character limits
    - Provide length examples
    - Use "concise" or "detailed" qualifiers appropriately
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't follow conditional logic">
    - Simplify conditions to be mutually exclusive
    - Use clear if-then-else structures
    - Test each condition path separately
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Remember that prompts in action parameters override agent-level prompts for that specific field. Ensure they complement rather than contradict each other.
</Warning>
