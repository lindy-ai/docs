## Quick Overview

AI Agents are autonomous components that can make decisions and execute skills based on guidelines you provide. Unlike fixed workflows, they adapt to uncertain situations by choosing which actions to take and when. While powerful, they're more expensive and introduce variability compared to standard actions and conditions.

Key characteristics:
- **Autonomous decision-making** - Agents decide which skills to use and when
- **Flexible execution** - Adapt to unexpected scenarios and data
- **Skill-based actions** - Execute multiple capabilities as needed
- **Guideline-driven** - Follow broad instructions rather than rigid steps
- **Loop until complete** - Continue working until exit conditions are met

<Warning>
AI Agents are powerful but more expensive and potentially less reliable than standard actions. Use them only when the next steps are truly uncertain. When possible, use actions and conditions instead.
</Warning>


## Understanding AI Agent Components

AI Agents consist of five essential parts that work together:

### 1. Prompt
The core instructions that guide your agent's behavior. Think of this as the agent's mission statement - what it should accomplish and how.

### 2. Model
The AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) that powers the agent's decision-making capabilities.

### 3. Ask for Confirmation
Optional human-in-the-loop feature that requires approval before the agent executes certain actions.

### 4. Skills
The actions and capabilities available to the agent. These are the tools it can use to accomplish its goals.

### 5. Exit Conditions
Criteria that tell the agent when its task is complete and it should proceed to the next workflow step.


## Adding an AI Agent

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/enter_ai_agent.png" alt="IMAGE NEEDED: Screenshot of clicking 'Enter AI agent' option when adding a step" />
</Frame>

Click the plus button in your workflow and select "Enter AI agent" to add the AI Agent step.


## Configuring Your AI Agent

### Setting the Agent Prompt

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/ai-agent-prompt-field.png" alt="IMAGE NEEDED: Screenshot of AI Agent configuration panel showing the prompt field" />
</Frame>

Add clear instructions for your agent. Example prompt:

```
Use what you know about the emailer to find their:
- Company name
- Company founding date
- Company headcount
- LinkedIn profile URL

Research thoroughly using web searches and compile accurate information.
```

### Adding Skills

Skills are the actions your agent can perform. Click the plus button beside "Skills" to add capabilities.

    />
  </div>
</div>

For our research agent, add:
- **Web Search** - Find relevant pages
- **Website Content Crawler** - Crawl websites and extract text content to feed AI models, LLM applications, and RAG pipelines

<Tip>
Give your agent complementary skills. For research tasks, combining search and content extraction provides comprehensive capabilities.
</Tip>

### Defining Exit Conditions

Exit conditions tell your agent when to stop and proceed to the next workflow step.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <div className="video-card">
    <video
      src="/lindy-brand-assets/ai_agent_exit_condition.mp4"
      width="600"
      autoPlay
      muted
      loop
      playsInline
      style={{ display: 'block', width: '100%', borderRadius: '16px' }}
    />
  </div>
</div>

The agent will continue researching until this condition is met.



## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use AI Agents Sparingly">
    Only use AI Agents when the next steps are genuinely uncertain. For predictable workflows, use standard actions and conditions for better reliability and lower costs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write Clear, Specific Prompts">
    Provide detailed instructions about what information to find, how to evaluate it, and what constitutes success. Vague prompts lead to inconsistent results.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Choose Appropriate Skills">
    Give your agent only the skills it needs. Too many options can lead to confusion; too few limit effectiveness.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define Clear Exit Conditions">
    Be specific about when the agent should stop. Ambiguous exit conditions can cause infinite loops or premature exits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test Thoroughly">
    AI Agents introduce variability. Test with diverse inputs to ensure consistent performance across scenarios.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent Stuck in Loop">
    - Check if exit conditions are achievable
    - Ensure skills can gather required information
    - Add iteration limits to the prompt
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Results">
    - Add specific examples to prompts
    - Use more deterministic models
    - Add validation after completion
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="High Costs">
    - Verify AI Agent is necessary
    - Limit skills to essentials only
    - Consider using conditions instead
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Skills Not Being Used">
    - Check skill permissions
    - Clarify in prompt when to use each skill
    - Test skills individually first
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
If costs are high or results inconsistent, consider using conditions and standard actions instead of AI Agents.
</Warning>
