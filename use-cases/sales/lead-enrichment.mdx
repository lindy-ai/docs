## Quick Overview

Drop a lead's basic details into Google Sheets and let Lindy:

- **Search** for contact details using People Data Labs
- **Find** their LinkedIn profile URL through multiple sources
- **Scrape** full LinkedIn profile data when found
- **Research** company news, funding, and buying signals
- **Update** your sheet with all enriched data automatically

You can use the [lead enrichment template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=687575ad808fe9c345b054cb) to get started.

## Setting Up Your Lead Enrichment Flow

### Step 1: Configure Your Spreadsheet Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-trigger.png" alt="New row trigger setup" />
</Frame>

1. Select `Google Sheets – New Row Added` as your trigger
2. Connect your spreadsheet with columns for:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Company
   - Role
   - Email
   - LinkedIn URL
   - Background
   - Company News
3. Paste your spreadsheet link in the trigger settings

**Google Sheets integrations always interpret first row as headers.**

### Step 2: Search with People Data Labs

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-PDL.png" alt="People Data Labs search" />
</Frame>

Use `People Data Labs – Search for People` action:

Recommend limiting results to `2` as each person queried consumes credits.

### Step 3: Double Down on LinkedIn Search

<Frame>

</Frame>

Add `Search the Internet` as a backup method:

```
site:linkedin.com/in [Full Name] [Company Name]
```

This ensures you catch LinkedIn profiles that People Data Labs might miss.

### Step 4: Check If LinkedIn Was Found

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-condition.png" alt="LinkedIn found condition" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition` step:
- **LinkedIn found**: If we have a LinkedIn URL from either search
- **LinkedIn not found**: If both searches came up empty

This branches your flow based on whether you can scrape LinkedIn data.

### Step 5: Scrape LinkedIn Profile (If Found)

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-LI.png" alt="LinkedIn profile scraping" />
</Frame>

If LinkedIn was found, use `LinkedIn – Get Profile by URL`:
- Input: The LinkedIn URL from previous steps
- Extracts: Full work history, skills, education, bio
- Wait for "After results available" before proceeding

### Step 6: Research with Perplexity

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-perplexity.png" alt="Perplexity company research" />
</Frame>

Use `Search Perplexity` for company intelligence:

```
Tell me about [Full Name] at [Company Name] and any recent company news, funding, or major initiatives in the last 6 months.
```

### Step 7: Update Your Spreadsheet

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/lead-enrich-update-row.png" alt="Update spreadsheet row" />
</Frame>

Use `Google Sheets – Update Row`:
- Match on the row from `New Row Added` trigger
- Update all enriched fields:
  - Full Name (required)
  - Company
  - Role
  - Email
  - LinkedIn URL
  - Background
  - Company News
