## Setting Up Your Lead Qualification Flow

### Step 1: Choose Your Lead Source Trigger

</Frame>

Select from common lead sources:
- `HubSpot – New Contact Created`
- `Salesforce – New Lead Created`
- `Google Forms – New Response`
- `Typeform – New Submission`
- `Webhooks` for custom integrations

### Step 2: Define Qualification Criteria

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Qualification scoring" />
</Frame>

Set up scoring logic based on your ICP:

**Budget Qualification:**
- Annual Revenue > $1M = 20 points
- Department Budget > $50K = 15 points
- Mentions "budget approved" = 10 points

**Authority Qualification:**
- C-Level = 25 points
- VP/Director = 20 points
- Manager = 10 points

**Need Qualification:**
- Mentions pain points = 15 points
- Timeline within 6 months = 10 points
- Currently evaluating solutions = 20 points

### Step 3: Research and Enrich

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Lead research" />
</Frame>

Use research actions to gather intel:

- **People Data Labs**: Get complete contact info and job history
- **Perplexity Search**: Find recent company news and funding
- **LinkedIn Search**: Verify prospect details and connections
- **Company Website Scraper**: Extract tech stack and signals

### Step 4: Calculate Lead Score

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Lead scoring" />
</Frame>

Create a scoring prompt:

```
Based on the lead information, calculate a qualification score (0-100):

Budget Score: {{budgetScore}}
Authority Score: {{authorityScore}}  
Need Score: {{needScore}}
Timing Score: {{timingScore}}

Total Score: {{totalScore}}

Qualification Level:
- 80-100: Hot Lead (A1)
- 60-79: Warm Lead (B1)
- 40-59: Cold Lead (C1)
- 0-39: Unqualified

```

### Step 5: Route and Update CRM

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Lead routing" />
</Frame>

Based on qualification score:

**Hot Leads (80+):**
- Assign to senior AE
- Send Slack notification
- Schedule immediate follow-up call

**Warm Leads (60-79):**
- Assign to appropriate rep
- Add to nurture sequence
- Update lead status to "Qualified"

**Cold Leads (40-59):**
- Add to long-term nurture
- Flag for future re-qualification
