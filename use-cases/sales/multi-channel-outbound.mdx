## Quick Overview

Let Lindy act as a self-learning SDR that:

- **Triggers** when a new lead appears in Sheets or Task view  
- **Crafts** personalized first-touch emails (and texts if the lead has opted in)  
- **Waits** a set interval, then follows up with added value  
- **Calls** qualified leads by phone to book meetings  
- **Alerts** you the moment a lead replies—or after the full cadence with no response  

You'll find the **Lead Outreacher** template in your Lindy dashboard to kick-start the flow.

## Setting Up Your Outbound Flow

### Step 1: Lead Trigger

<Frame>

</Frame>

1. Add both `Google Sheets – New Row Added` *and* `Message Received` triggers.  
2. Paste your Sheet URL in the trigger settings.  
3. Optional: upload a CSV or DM Lindy in Task view to start ad-hoc outreach.

### Step 2: Enrich the Lead (Optional)

</Frame>

- Insert `People Data Labs – Enrich Person` or a `Lead Enrichment` sub-flow.  
- More context → better personalization and reply rates.

### Step 3: Send First-Touch Email / SMS

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="First outreach email" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Gmail – Send Email`  
- **Ask for Confirmation** toggle if you need human approval.  
- Body prompt:  
```
Write a personalized email using sheet data (Name, Title, Company).
Keep it friendly, <120 words, end with a clear CTA.
```
- If the lead provided an opted-in mobile number, add `Twilio – Send SMS` with a shorter variant.

### Step 4: Wait, Then Follow-Up

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Wait action" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Wait – For Minutes` set to 4320 (three days).  
- Add `Gmail – Send Reply` for follow-up #1.  
- Repeat Wait + Reply as many times as needed.

### Step 5: Make an Outbound Call (Optional)

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Outbound phone call" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Lindy Phone – Make Outbound Call`  
- `To` field prompt:  
```
use the phone number from the lead row
```
- Inside, an `AI Agent` books a consultation or leaves voicemail.  
- **Opt-in compliance**: only call if `Opt-In` column = `Yes`.

### Step 6: Alert & Exit

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Slack alert" />
</Frame>

- If the lead replies at any point → `Slack – Send DM` with interest level + task URL.  
- If cadence finishes with no reply → different Slack alert so you can decide next steps.
