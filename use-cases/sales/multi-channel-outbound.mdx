## Quick Overview

Let your Lindy agent act as a self-learning SDR that:

- **Triggers** when a new lead appears in Sheets or Task view  
- **Crafts** personalized first-touch emails (and texts if the lead has opted in)  
- **Waits** a set interval, then follows up with added value  
- **Calls** qualified leads by phone to book meetings  
- **Alerts** you the moment a lead replies—or after the full cadence with no response  

Start from the [multichannel outbound template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=6875c321cb447178e1192a26) and customize.

## Setting Up Your Outbound Flow

### Step 1: Lead Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/multi-channel-trigger.png" alt="New Row trigger and task message" />
</Frame>

1. Add both `Google Sheets – New Row Added` *and* `Message Received` triggers.  
2. **Your input must have email or phone # depending on the form of outreach.**  
3. Optional: upload a CSV or DM Lindy in Task view to start ad-hoc outreach.

### Step 2: Enrich the Lead (Optional)

Optionally add an enrichment step to gather additional context about your prospects for better personalization.

</Frame>

- Follow the [Lead Enrichment tutorial](/use-cases/sales/lead-enrichment) to learn how to enrich a lead.
- More context → better personalization and reply rates.

### Step 3: Wait, Then Follow-Up

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/multi-channel-followup.png" alt="Wait action" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Wait – For Minutes` set to 4320 (three days).  
- Add `Gmail – Send Reply` for follow-up #1.  
- Repeat Wait + Reply as many times as needed.
Example prompt:

```
Follow up with the lead. This time, send them a snappy, persuasive, two sentence email. 

It should follow one of these templates: 

"Hey [NAME], [Example company] achieved a 30% increase on ROAS within 3 months of getting in touch with us. 

Want to learn how?"

or 

"Hey [NAME], wanted to share with you [this] (www.example.com) 30sec demo video so you can have a better sense on how to achieve [insert specific company goal/initiative]. 

Lmk your thoughts,"
```

### Step 4: Make an Outbound Call (Optional)

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/multi-channel-agent.png" alt="Outbound phone call" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Lindy Phone – Make Outbound Call`  

Example prompt:

```
You are on a phone call with a qualified inbound sales lead.

**Follow these conversation steps (note: items in [square brackets] are variables to be extracted from the received message):**

1. Introduce yourself briefly:

"Hi [$FIRSTNAME], my name is Lindy. I noticed you signed up for [PRODUCT/SERVICE/FORM FROM MESSAGE]. I wanted to follow up and see if you'd like to schedule a 15-minute free consultation to learn more about [USER'S PRODUCT/COMPANY]."


2. [Instruction]: WAIT FOR THE OTHER PERSON TO RESPOND BEFORE CONTINUING.


3. Continue the conversation naturally, aiming to have them book a time with the team. 

**Always use the EXIT CONDITION (Find Available Times action) before scheduling an event.**

**Always PAUSE and wait for the user to respond when giving times.**

4. [Instruction]: WAIT FOR THE USER ON THE PHONE TO RESPOND AFTER YOU GAVE THEM TIME OPTIONS. 

**Booking the Consultation Hints:**

* WAIT after suggesting three available times *

5. When the user:

* Accepts a time: Thank them and ask them to check their calendar for the invite and accept it to confirm (do not add anything else to this statement / request)

* Declines booking: Act as a thoughtful and persuasive negotiator (e.g., ask why they're uninterested in {THE PRODUCT}) before concluding the conversation

[Instruction]: WAIT FOR THE USER ON THE PHONE TO RESPOND AFTER YOU REQUEST FOR THEM TO CONFIRM THE CALENDAR INVITE. 

5. Summarize the outcome:
* If accepted: "To wrap things up, I wanted to confirm that you are booked to meet with the team at [EVENT TIME AND DATE]" (do not mention the day and time if you have already mentioned it previously)

* If declined: "Thank you for taking the time to consider connecting with the team"

[Instruction]: WAIT FOR THE OTHER PERSON TO RESPOND BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ASK IF THEY NEED HELP WITH ANYTHING ELSE. 

6. Ask: "Is there anything else I can help you with?"

After they confirm nothing else is needed, thank them and end the call.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:

* If initial times don't work, don't give up. Continue using the EXIT CONDITION to Find Available Times until you find a suitable option
* Demonstrate skilled negotiation by working to find mutually agreeable times
* Always maintain a professional and helpful demeanor throughout the conversation
* Always do your best to book the consultation. If they say no initially, ensure you respond with concise rebuttals to persuade them to book a consultation. 
```

### Step 6: Alert & Exit

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/multi-channel-slack.png" alt="Slack alert" />
</Frame>

- If the lead replies at any point → `Cancel Timers` to stop the sequence and prevent future outreach
- After canceling timers send a slack update with a summary of the outcome and sentiment
- If cadence finishes with no reply → different Slack alert so you can decide next steps.
