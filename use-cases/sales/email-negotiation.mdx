## Quick Overview

With the Email Negotiator flow, Lindy will:

- **Monitor** your inbox for pricing or partnership inquiries  
- **Query** a rich knowledge base for rates, packages, and policies  
- **Respond** in your brand voice with accurate info  
- **Negotiate** back-and-forth until a deal is closed or lost  
- **Escalate** edge cases or wins straight to you via Slack  

Start from the **Email Responder** template in your Lindy dashboard and tweak as below.

## Setting Up Your Negotiator

### Step 1: Connect the Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Gmail trigger" />
</Frame>

1. Use `Gmail – Email Received` as the trigger.  
2. Add filters to ignore internal threads or newsletters.

### Step 2: Gate with a Condition

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Deserves reply condition" />
</Frame>

`Condition` prompt:

```
Only continue if the email asks about pricing, packages, quotes, discounts, or partnerships.
```

### Step 3: Build the Knowledge Base

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Knowledge base" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Search Knowledge Base`  
- Upload FAQs, rate cards, discount policies, and negotiation guidelines.  
- Connect CRM or Google Docs as needed.

### Step 4: Verify an Answer Exists

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Found answer condition" />
</Frame>

Add `Condition – Found answer?`  
- **Yes** → proceed to first reply.  
- **No** → send you a Slack DM for manual follow-up.

### Step 5: Send the First Reply

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="First reply" />
</Frame>

Body prompt:

```
Use knowledge base content to answer questions and offer next steps.
Be concise, friendly, and on-brand.
```

Toggle `Ask for Confirmation` = Always (optional).

### Step 6: Branch on Response Type

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Three-way condition" />
</Frame>

Add a three-way `Condition`:

| Path               | Prompt snippet                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requires Negotiation | the email asks for more options, discounts, or custom packages                    |
| Closed Deal          | the email agrees to the quoted terms                                             |
| Not Interested       | the email declines the offer                                                     |

### Step 7: AI Agent for Negotiation

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI agent negotiation" />
</Frame>

- Under *Requires Negotiation*, insert `AI Agent` with skills: `Gmail – Send Reply`.  
- Prompt guidelines: use only KB facts, stay within 1-2 sentences, sign "Thanks – Lindy".

### Step 8: Close the Loop

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Closed deal reply" />
</Frame>

- *Closed Deal* → `Gmail – Send Reply` confirming terms and next steps.  
- *Not Interested* → polite thank-you reply.  
- Both paths → `Slack – Send DM` to alert your team.
