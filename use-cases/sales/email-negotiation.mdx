## Quick Overview

With the Email Negotiator flow, Lindy will:

- **Monitor** your inbox for pricing or partnership inquiries  
- **Query** a rich knowledge base for rates, packages, and policies  
- **Respond** in your brand voice with accurate info  
- **Negotiate** back-and-forth until a deal is closed or lost  
- **Escalate** edge cases or wins straight to you via Slack  

Start from the [email responder template](https://chat.lindy.ai/marketplace/?templateId=66bfc603ea73bec3fea906db) and tweak as below.

## Setting Up Your Negotiator

### Step 1: Connect the Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-trigger.png" alt="Gmail trigger" />
</Frame>

1. Use `Gmail – Email Received` as the trigger.  
2. Add filters to ignore internal threads or newsletters.

### Step 2: Gate with a Condition

Filter out irrelevant emails early to avoid wasting resources on messages that don't need negotiation.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-condition.png" alt="Deserves reply condition" />
</Frame>

`Condition` prompt:

```
Only continue if the email asks about pricing, packages, quotes, discounts, or partnerships.
```

### Step 3: Build the Knowledge Base

Create a central repository of pricing and policy information so Lindy can provide accurate, consistent responses.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-KB.png" alt="Knowledge base" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Search Knowledge Base`  
- Upload FAQs, rate cards, discount policies, and negotiation guidelines.  
- Connect CRM or Google Docs as needed.

### Step 4: Verify an Answer Exists

Check if we have the information needed to respond before attempting to negotiate, preventing unhelpful responses.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-found-action.png" alt="Found answer condition" />
</Frame>

### Step 5: Send the First Reply

Provide an initial response with relevant information to begin the negotiation process professionally.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-first-reply.png" alt="First reply" />
</Frame>

Example prompt:

```
You are responding to an inbound partnership inquiry email. 

Your job is to use the content in your knowledge base to answer the emailer’s questions, respond succinctly and help the user close a partnership deal*

An example response could be:

"Hey {FIRSTNAME}, thanks so much for reaching out! I'd love to learn more about {THEIR BRAND} and see if there is mutual alignment for a partnership.

Here are my rates:

{Insert content found from knowledge base, example below:- Youtube Shorts = $2,500- 30 Sec Reel on Instagram = $3,000- 60 sec Reel on Instagram = $6,500- TikTok Reel = $12,000 ($14,000 if pinned)}

Please let me know your thoughts and any ideas you had on specific collab content."
```

### Step 6: Branch on Response Type

Categorize the prospect's response to determine the appropriate next action in the negotiation flow.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-conditions.png" alt="Three-way condition" />
</Frame>

Add a three-way `Condition`:

| Path               | Prompt snippet                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requires Negotiation | the email requires further negotiation                    |
| Closed Deal          | the email agrees to the quoted terms                                             |
| Not Interested       | the email declines the offer                                                     |

### Step 7: AI Agent for Negotiation

Deploy an AI agent to handle back-and-forth negotiations automatically while staying within your guidelines.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-ai-agent.png" alt="AI agent negotiation" />
</Frame>

- Under *Requires Negotiation*, insert `AI Agent` with skills: `Gmail – Send Reply`.  
- Example prompt:

```
Your job is to negotiate with the emailer and respond to their questions until a decision is made in regard to the partnership opportunity. Only answer questions using answers found from the knowledge base. Here are some example responses to mirror the structure and style of our brand’s tone:

“Hey {FIRSTNAME} – appreciate the interest! We only discount 10% for fall deals, as it is our busiest time for collaborations. Let me know what you decide!”

“Hi {FIRSTNAME}, thanks for the follow-up questions. We typically post on Mondays at 8:00am PST and pin them for 4 weeks. If you would like a collab post pinned longer than 4 weeks, we charge $1,000 extra per week that is pinned.

Let me know if this sounds good to you or if you have questions :)” 

Important Instructions: 

* Always respond directly to the emailer and sign off with: 

“Thanks – Lindy”

* Keep responses 1-2 sentences long, concise and friendly. 

* Never make offerings or agree to a deal unless there is content in the knowledge base that supports the partnership details.
```

### Step 8: Close the Loop

Finalize the negotiation outcome after it is complete and send them to the correct path whether or not the deal was closed.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-negotiator-close-loop.png" alt="Closed deal reply" />
</Frame>

- *Closed Deal* → `Gmail – Send Reply` confirming terms and next steps.  
- *Not Interested* → polite thank-you reply.  
- Both paths → `Slack – Send DM` to alert your team.
