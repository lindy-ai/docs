## Quick Overview

Transform any Slack channel into an intelligent employee help desk. Lindy will:

- **Monitor** employee questions in your designated help channels 24/7
- **Search** your company knowledge base for relevant policies and procedures
- **Respond** instantly with accurate, friendly answers to common questions
- **Escalate** complex or sensitive issues to HR with full context
- **Continue** monitoring conversations for follow-up questions

You can use the [employee helpdesk template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=6875fa3a17018229eea893fe) to get started.
## Setting Up Your Employee Help Desk

### Step 1: Connect Slack Channel

Set up monitoring for employee questions in your designated help channel.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-trigger.png" alt="Slack message trigger setup" />
</Frame>

1. Use `Slack â€“ Message Received` trigger
2. Select your help channel (e.g., #ask-hr, #employee-help, #general-questions)

<Warning>
Make sure to add Lindy as an integration to your Slack channel so it can monitor and respond to messages.
</Warning>

### Step 2: Search Company Knowledge Base

Query your company documentation to find relevant information for the employee's question.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-KB.png" alt="Knowledge base search for company info" />
</Frame>

Use `Search Knowledge Base` with the employee's message as the query.

Upload your essential company documents:
- Employee handbook
- Benefits documentation  
- PTO policies
- IT setup guides
- Office procedures
- Expense policies

<Tip>
The more comprehensive your knowledge base, the better Lindy can help your employees without escalation.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Draft Response with AI

Have AI analyze the context and create an appropriate response or determine it cannot answer.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-agent.png" alt="AI response drafting" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent â€“ Draft Employee Response`:

```
You are a helpful and professional employee assistant representing HR.

Using the knowledge base results, respond to this employee question: slack_message

GUIDELINES:
- Keep concise for Slack readability
- Be friendly, professional, and empathetic
- Use bullet points for clarity when listing multiple items
- If you found relevant information: Provide a clear answer with policy reference
- If information is unclear or missing: Respond with "I don't have that specific information available"

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Direct answer to their question
- Reference to relevant policy/document if applicable  
- Offer to escalate if needed: "If you need more details, I can connect you with HR directly"

IMPORTANT RULE: IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN YOUR CONTEXT - ONLY REPLY "ANSWER NOT FOUND" AND EXIT

Return ONLY the response text, no additional formatting.
```

### Step 4: Check if Answer Found

Determine whether to respond directly or escalate based on AI's ability to find relevant information.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-condition.png" alt="Answer found condition routing" />
</Frame>

- **Answer Not Found Path**: Route to HR escalation
- **Answer Found Path**: Route to direct response

### Step 5: Escalate to HR Manager

For questions the AI couldn't answer, send context to HR for personal follow-up.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-escalate.png" alt="HR escalation via DM" />
</Frame>

Use `Slack â€“ Send Direct Message` to HR manager:

```
ðŸ“‹ **Employee Question Needs Your Attention**

**From**: message_author
**Channel**: channel_name
**Question**: slack_message

**Thread Link**: message_link

Lindy couldn't find this information in our knowledge base. Please respond directly in the thread.
```
<Warning>
Remember to change the user email to the correct team member.
</Warning>

### Step 6: Reply to Employee

For questions with found answers, respond directly in the thread with helpful information using `Slack - Send Reply`.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-reply.png" alt="Direct response to employee" />
</Frame>


### Step 6: Monitor Thread for Follow-ups

Continuously watch the conversation thread for additional questions or clarifications.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-observe.png" alt="Thread observation and monitoring" />
</Frame>

Add `Observe Messages` action to monitor the thread for new messages.

This creates a listening state that waits for any new messages in the conversation.

### Step 7: Handle Follow-up Messages

Check if new messages in the thread require additional assistance or are just acknowledgments.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/helpdesk-handle-thread.png" alt="Follow-up message evaluation" />
</Frame>

Add `Conditions` with AI evaluation:

- **If NEEDS_RESPONSE**: Loop back to Step 2 (Search Knowledge Base)
- **If NO_RESPONSE**: Loop back to Step 6 (Continue Observing)
