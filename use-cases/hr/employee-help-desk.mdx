Here's an Employee Help Desk tutorial in the same format:

## Quick Overview

Turn any Slack channel into a smart help desk where Lindy:

- **Monitors** employee questions in designated help channels
- **Searches** your knowledge base (policies, FAQs, benefits docs)
- **Answers** common questions instantly with accurate information
- **Escalates** complex issues to HR or IT with full context
- **Tracks** frequently asked questions to improve documentation

You'll find the **Employee Help Desk** template in your Lindy dashboard to kick-start the flow.

## Setting Up Your Employee Help Desk

### Step 1: Connect Slack Channel

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Connect Slack workspace" />
</Frame>

1. Select `Slack Message Received` as the trigger
2. Choose your help channel (e.g., #ask-hr, #it-help, #general-questions)
3. Enable "Filter events on this trigger" 
4. Add filter: Message does NOT contain "from: Lindy" (to avoid loops)

### Step 2: Set Up Your Knowledge Base

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Configure knowledge base" />
</Frame>

Upload your company resources:
- Employee handbook PDF
- Benefits documentation
- IT setup guides
- Office policies
- Expense procedures
- PTO policies

Click `Knowledge Base` and select the folder containing these documents.

### Step 3: Categorize the Question

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Question categorization" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition` node to route questions:

```
Categorize this as: HR, IT, Finance, Facilities, or General
Question: {{slack_message}}
```

This helps with routing and analytics later.

### Step 4: Search for Answers

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Knowledge base search" />
</Frame>

Add `Search Knowledge Base` action:
- Query: `{{slack_message}}`
- Max results: 3
- Include relevance scores

### Step 5: Generate Response

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI response generation" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent - Generate Text`:

```
You are a helpful employee assistant. Using the knowledge base results, answer this question:
{{slack_message}}

If found in knowledge base: Provide a clear, friendly answer with the specific policy reference.
If NOT found: Say "I don't have that information, but I've flagged this for the {{category}} team."

Keep responses under 200 words. Use bullet points for clarity.
```

### Step 6: Reply in Thread

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Slack thread reply" />
</Frame>

Use `Slack - Send Message`:
- Channel: `{{trigger_channel}}`
- Thread: `{{message_ts}}` (keeps channel tidy)
- Message: `{{ai_response}}`

### Step 7: Handle Escalations

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Escalation routing" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition`: If knowledge base found no results
- `Slack - Send DM` to relevant team lead
- Include original question + employee name
- Create support ticket in your HRIS/ticketing system
