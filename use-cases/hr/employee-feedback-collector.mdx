You can use the [weekly employee feedback template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=6875fa3a17018229eea893fe) to get started.

## Quick Overview

Transform employee feedback collection from manual surveys to an automated weekly pulse system. Lindy will:

- **Schedule** weekly feedback campaigns automatically
- **Send** personalized feedback requests to each team member
- **Monitor** responses and alert you to feedback as it arrives
- **Compile** a weekly summary report after the collection period

No more chasing down feedback or manually organizing responses.

## Setting Up Your Feedback System

### Step 1: Weekly Schedule Trigger

Set up automatic weekly feedback collection to maintain consistent pulse checks.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-trigger.png" alt="Weekly schedule trigger setup" />
</Frame>

Use `On Recurring Schedule` set to weekly (e.g., Monday 9:00 AM) to kick off the feedback collection process automatically.

### Step 2: Get Employee Directory

Retrieve the list of employees who should receive feedback requests from your master spreadsheet.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-get-spreadsheet.png" alt="Employee spreadsheet lookup" />
</Frame>

Use `Google Sheets ‚Äì Get Spreadsheet` from your employee directory sheet.

Required columns:
- **Full Name**: Employee's complete name for personalization
- **Email**: Work email address for survey delivery

<Tip>
Keep your employee spreadsheet updated with current team members for accurate feedback collection. The default row limit is 100 - increase if you have more employees.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Start Employee Loop

Begin processing each employee individually to send personalized feedback requests.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-enter-loop.png" alt="For each employee loop start" />
</Frame>

Add the `rows` output reference from your `Get Spreadsheet` action to iterate through each employee row from your spreadsheet.

<Warning>
Increase the max cycles & concurrent above the number of employees you want to send feedback too.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Send Individual Feedback Email

Send personalized feedback requests to each employee with engaging questions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-send.png" alt="Personalized feedback email" />
</Frame>

Use `Gmail ‚Äì Send Email` with:

- **To**: employee email (auto is okay setting)
- **Example Subject**: Weekly Pulse Check - 2 Minutes üìù
- **Example Body**:

```
Hi employee_name,

Hope you're having a great week! Quick 3-question pulse check:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What went really well for you this week?

2Ô∏è‚É£ What was your biggest challenge or frustration?

3Ô∏è‚É£ One thing that would make next week better?

Just reply to this email - your feedback helps us improve!

Thanks,
The Team
```

### Step 5: Send Feedback to Private Channel

Immediately share feedback responses in a private Slack channel as they come in.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-private-slack.png" alt="Feedback response monitoring" />
</Frame>


Use `Slack ‚Äì Send Message` after email reply received:

```
üì¨ **New Feedback Received**

**From**: sender_name
**Received**: current_time

**Response**: full response
```

<Warning>
Remember to add Lindy app to the proper slack channel to correctly receive messages.
</Warning>

### Step 6: Add Feedback to Context

Add the full questions and answers from the person into tcontext for Lindy to compile a report.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-add-context.png" alt="Context collection for feedback" />
</Frame>

Use `Add Context` action with prompt:

```
Add the full questions and answers from this feedback response into the context:

Questions asked: [3 feedback questions]
Employee response: email_body
Received from: sender_name on current_date
```

### Step 7: Set Collection Timer

Set a 5-day timer to allow employees time to respond before compiling the final report.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-timer.png" alt="Timer for feedback collection" />
</Frame>

After sending each email, add `Set Timer` for 7200 minutes (5 days).

<Warning>
Make sure to connect the "after wait elapsed" output to the "exit loop" action. This is crucial for exiting the loop correctly at the right time.
</Warning>

### Step 8: Exit Loop

Exit the employee processing loop and prepare to compile the weekly report.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-exit-loop.png" alt="Exit loop processing" />
</Frame>

Add `Exit Loop` action with prompt:

```
If the employee did not reply to feedback request, leave this empty.
If the employee did reply, include the full context that you just received from their response.
```

<Tip>
Loops have scope memory - this step allows us to correctly transfer the collected feedback memory outside of the loop for final report generation.
</Tip>

### Step 9: Generate Weekly Report

After the collection period ends, compile all received feedback into a comprehensive weekly summary.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-agent.png" alt="Weekly report compilation" />
</Frame>

When timer elapses (Friday), exit the loop and use `AI Agent ‚Äì Generate Weekly Report`:

```
Compile a weekly feedback summary using all collected context.

ANALYSIS:
- Total responses received vs sent
- Overall sentiment (positive/mixed/negative)
- Top 3 recurring themes or issues
- Notable quotes (anonymized)
- Recommended focus areas for next week

FORMAT:
üìä **Weekly Feedback Summary** (Date Range)

**Response Rate**: X/Y employees (X%)
**Overall Sentiment**: [positive/mixed/negative]

**Key Themes**:
‚Ä¢ Theme 1 (mentioned X times)
‚Ä¢ Theme 2 (mentioned X times) 
‚Ä¢ Theme 3 (mentioned X times)

**Notable Feedback**:
"[Positive quote]"
"[Constructive feedback]"
"[Suggestion for improvement]"

**Recommended Focus**: [One key area for next week]

Keep summary under 200 words, actionable and clear.
```

### Step 10: Send Weekly Summary Email

Send the compiled feedback report to leadership for review and action planning.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/feedback-final-report.png" alt="Weekly summary delivery" />
</Frame>

Use `Gmail ‚Äì Send Email` to leadership team with the report you just generated:

- **To**: leadership_emails
- **Subject**: Weekly Team Feedback Summary - week_dates
- **Body**: the full exact report you just generated in markdown
