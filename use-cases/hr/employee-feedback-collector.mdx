## Quick Overview

Each week, Lindy will:

- **Email** every employee a 3-question pulse check  
- **Listen** for their replies and add them to a Google Sheet  
- **Summarize** themes, sentiment, and standout quotes every Friday  
- **Send** a concise digest to leadership via Slack or email  

## Building the Flow

### Step 1: Weekly Survey Blast

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Scheduler + email blast" />
</Frame>

1. `Scheduler – Weekly` → Monday 09:00.  
2. `Gmail – Send Email`  
   - **To**: comma-separated employee list (or Google Group).  
   - **Subject**: `Weekly Pulse – 2-minute check-in 🙌`.  
   - **Body**:  
     ```
     Hi team!

     1) What went well last week?  
     2) Biggest frustration or blocker?  
     3) One idea to make next week smoother?

     Reply directly to this email—answers are anonymous in the summary.
     Thanks!
     ```

### Step 2: Capture Replies

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Email received trigger" />
</Frame>

- Trigger: `Gmail – Email Received`  
- Filter: `subject contains "Weekly Pulse"`.

### Step 3: Log to Google Sheets

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Append row" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Google Sheets – Append Row`  
- Columns: Date, RawBody, From (anonymize by storing only domain or alias).

### Step 4: Weekly Digest

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Weekly summary" />
</Frame>

1. `Scheduler – Weekly` → Friday 16:00.  
2. `Google Sheets – Read Rows` for current week.  
3. `AI Agent – Generate Text` prompt:

```
You have array {{rows}} each with "RawBody".

• Count total responses.
• Detect overall sentiment (positive / mixed / negative).
• List top 3 recurring words or phrases (≤4 words each).
• Quote 2 upbeat lines and 2 concerns (anonymized).
• Suggest one focus area for next week in ≤12 words.

Format as:

---

🗒️ *Weekly Feedback Digest* (Jun 9–15)

• Responses: 37
• Sentiment: mixed
• Top themes: deployment delay, PTO overlap, new dashboard love

"Launch felt smoother than last month!"
"Staging server kept timing out."
"Would like clearer PTO calendar."
"Dashboard update is awesome 👏"

*Focus → reduce staging downtime*
```

### Step 5: Deliver the Digest

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Slack post" />
</Frame>

- `Slack – Send Channel Message` to `#leadership-digests` (or `Gmail – Send Email` to execs).  
- Message body: output from the AI Agent.

<Tip>
Prefer Slack DMs? Swap Steps 1 & 5 for `Slack – Send Direct Message` to each employee and back to the channel for the digest—the rest of the flow stays the same.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Short">
    Three questions = highest response rates; avoid survey fatigue.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Reinforce Anonymity">
    Strip names/emails when appending rows so answers stay candid.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Close the Loop">
    Start Monday stand-up by highlighting one change inspired by the feedback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Iterate on Prompts">
    Tweak wording after the first two digests to match team voice and length.
  </Accordion>
