## Quick Overview

CC Lindy on any thread and she will:

- **Detect** whether a specific time was suggested  
- **Propose** three slots if none was given  
- **Book** the meeting on your calendar with full context  
- **Confirm** with all parties once the invite is sent  
- **Reschedule** gracefully if plans change  

You'll find the **Meeting Scheduler** template in your Lindy dashboard to kick-start the flow.

## Setting Up Your Meeting Scheduler

### Step 1: Configure Lindy Mail

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Lindy Mail address" />
</Frame>

1. Open the `Email Received` trigger.  
2. Copy your unique **Lindy Mail Address**—this is the address you'll CC.  
3. Optionally whitelist domains or subjects to limit when Lindy acts.

### Step 2: Understand the Initial Condition

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Condition for time detection" />
</Frame>

The first `Condition` checks the email body:

```
Does the email specify a date or time?
```

- **Yes** → jump to event creation.  
- **No** → find best times to propose.

### Step 3: List Best Times

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="List best times" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Google Calendar – List Best Times`  
- Set earliest/latest start, working hours, max meetings per day, and calendars to check.  

### Step 4: Reply With Times

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Send times email" />
</Frame>

`Lindy Mail – Send Reply` with body:

```
Hi {{FIRSTNAME}},

Happy to help schedule! Do any of these work for you? (all times in {{TIMEZONE}})

* Monday, June 21 at 3 PM
* Tuesday, June 22 at 11 AM
* Wednesday, June 23 at 1 PM

Best,
Lindy
```

### Step 5: Create the Event

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Create calendar event" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Google Calendar – Create Event`  
- Leave most fields on *Auto*; prompt the name/description using email context.  
- Add a meeting link only if the thread agreed to virtual.

### Step 6: Confirm or Reschedule

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Confirmation email" />
</Frame>

1. `Lindy Mail – Send Reply` to confirm booking:

```
Sounds great, I just sent the invite! Let me know if I can help with anything else.
```

2. Final `Condition` watches for reschedule requests; if true, delete the old event and loop back to Step 3.
