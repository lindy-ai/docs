## Quick Overview

A Meeting Notetaker Lindy automatically joins your scheduled meetings, records the conversation, and creates detailed summaries with action items, decisions, and key discussion points. It's like having a dedicated assistant in every meeting who never misses a detail and always delivers organized notes.

Key benefits of using a Meeting Notetaker:
- **Automatic attendance** - Lindy joins meetings based on your calendar without manual intervention
- **Comprehensive notes** - Captures all important discussions, decisions, and action items
- **Organized storage** - Saves meeting notes in your preferred cloud storage with consistent formatting
- **Searchable archive** - Creates a searchable repository of all your meeting history
- **Team alignment** - Ensures everyone has access to the same information, even if they missed the meeting

## Setting Up Your Meeting Notetaker

Let's create a Meeting Notetaker that will automatically join your meetings and generate comprehensive notes.

### Step 1: Configure Calendar Integration

First, connect your calendar so Lindy knows which meetings to join.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-calendar-integration.png" alt="Connecting your calendar to Lindy" />
</Frame>

Click the **Calendar Event Started** trigger and select the calendar you want Lindy to monitor. This can be your personal calendar or a shared team calendar.

<Tip>
  Pro tip: Use filters to have Lindy only join specific types of meetings. For example, filter by meeting title containing "Team Sync" or "Client Call".
</Tip>

### Step 2: Set Up Meeting Recording

Configure how Lindy will join and behave in your meetings.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-meeting-settings.png" alt="Configuring meeting recording settings" />
</Frame>

In the **Record Meeting** action:
- Leave "Meeting URL" on "Auto" to let Lindy intelligently find the meeting link
- Customize the join message or leave it blank for silent entry
- Set your Lindy-bot's display name (e.g., "Sarah's Notetaker")

### Step 3: Configure Note Generation

Customize how Lindy processes and formats your meeting notes.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-note-template.png" alt="Setting up note generation template" />
</Frame>

In the **Generate Meeting Summary** action, you can customize the prompt to focus on what matters most to your workflow:

```
Create a comprehensive meeting summary including:
- Meeting title, date, and attendees
- Key discussion points organized by topic
- All decisions made with clear owners
- Action items with assignees and due dates
- Questions that remain unanswered
- Next steps and follow-up meetings scheduled
```

### Step 4: Set Up Cloud Storage

Configure where your meeting notes will be saved for easy access.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-storage-setup.png" alt="Configuring Google Drive storage for meeting notes" />
</Frame>

1. Create a dedicated folder in Google Drive (e.g., "Meeting Notes 2024")
2. In the **Google Docs Create Document** action:
   - Select your Meeting Notes folder
   - Use dynamic naming: `{{meeting_title}} - {{meeting_date}}`
   - Choose your preferred formatting template

## Advanced Features

### Adding Smart Categorization

Use conditions to automatically categorize and route different types of meetings.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-categorization.png" alt="Setting up meeting categorization with conditions" />
</Frame>

Example conditions:
- "Client meetings" → Save to Client folder and notify sales team
- "Internal standup" → Create brief summary and post to Slack
- "Board meetings" → Generate detailed minutes and mark as confidential

### Email Follow-ups

Automatically send meeting summaries to attendees who couldn't make it.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-email-followup.png" alt="Configuring automatic email follow-ups" />
</Frame>

Add an **Email Send** action with:
- Recipients: Meeting attendees or specific team members
- Subject: "Meeting Notes: {{meeting_title}}"
- Body: Include the generated summary with highlighted action items

### Integration with Task Management

Connect your Meeting Notetaker to project management tools for seamless task creation.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-task-integration.png" alt="Creating tasks from meeting action items" />
</Frame>

Use integrations to:
- Create Asana tasks from action items
- Update Linear issues mentioned in meetings
- Add Notion database entries for decisions made

## Testing Your Meeting Notetaker

Before going live, test your Lindy to ensure everything works perfectly.

<Frame>
  <img src="/placeholder-test-panel.png" alt="Testing your Meeting Notetaker in the test panel" />
</Frame>

1. Schedule a test meeting on your calendar
2. Use the test panel to simulate the workflow
3. Verify that notes are generated and saved correctly
4. Check that any integrations (Slack, email, etc.) work as expected

<Warning>
  During testing, use short test meetings to avoid consuming your recording minutes. You can also test with meeting transcript uploads instead of live recordings.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Meeting Etiquette">
    Inform meeting participants that Lindy will be taking notes. Consider adding a line to your calendar invites: "Note: An AI notetaker will join to capture meeting notes."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Privacy Considerations">
    Set up filters to exclude sensitive meetings like performance reviews or confidential discussions. Use calendar event titles or attendee lists as filter criteria.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Note Organization">
    Create a consistent folder structure in your cloud storage. Consider organizing by date, project, or meeting type for easy retrieval.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review and Refine">
    Periodically review the generated notes and refine your prompts. The more specific your instructions, the better Lindy becomes at capturing what matters to you.
