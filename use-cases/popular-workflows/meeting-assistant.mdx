## Quick Overview

A Meeting Notetaker Lindy automatically joins your scheduled meetings, records the conversation, and creates detailed summaries with action items, decisions, and key discussion points. It's like having a dedicated assistant in every meeting who never misses a detail and always delivers organized notes.

You can find a `Meeting Notetaker template` on the left-hand side of your Lindy dashboard to get started quickly.

Key benefits of using a Meeting Notetaker:
- **Automatic attendance** - Lindy joins meetings based on your calendar without manual intervention
- **Comprehensive notes** - Captures all important discussions, decisions, and action items
- **Organized storage** - Saves meeting notes in your preferred format with consistent formatting
- **Searchable archive** - Creates a searchable repository of all your meeting history
- **Team alignment** - Ensures everyone has access to the same information, even if they missed the meeting

## Setting Up Your Meeting Notetaker

Once you've clicked on the Meeting Notetaker template to your account, open the Flow Editor to see how it works. Let's walk through each step to customize it for your needs.

### Step 1: Connect Your Calendar

Start by connecting the Google Calendar that contains the meetings you want Lindy to join.

</Frame>

Click the `Calendar Event Started` trigger and select the calendar you want Lindy to monitor. This can be your personal calendar or a shared team calendar.


### Step 2: Filter for Virtual Meetings

The next step is a `Condition` that ensures Lindy only processes virtual meetings.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/meeting-recorder-filter.png" alt="Virtual meeting condition" />
</Frame>

This condition uses the prompt: "if the event contains a meeting link" to filter out in-person meetings or events without video conference links.

You can add trigger filters to give you more control over which meetings Lindy joins. For example:
- Filter for events containing "Demo Call" in the name
- Only join meetings with specific attendees
- Skip meetings marked as "Private"

<Tip>
  Pro tip: Use filters to have Lindy only join specific types of meetings. This prevents Lindy from joining every calendar event, like personal appointments.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Configure Meeting Recording

Now let's set up how Lindy will join and behave in your meetings.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/meeting-recorder-config-name.png" alt="Configuring meeting recording settings" />
</Frame>

In the `Record Meeting` action you can customize several options, but here are a few suggestions:

#### Chat Message Settings
- **Chat Message On Join**: Customize what Lindy says when joining (or leave blank for silent entry)
- **Name**: Set your Lindy-bot's display name (e.g., "Sarah's Notetaker")

#### Recording Options
- Meeting URL is set to "Auto" so Lindy intelligently finds the meeting link
- Recording will start automatically when Lindy joins

### Step 4: Email Meeting Recap to Attendees

Set up an email to automatically send meeting summaries to all attendees with the `Gmail Send Email` action.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/meeting-recorder-send-email.png" alt="Email attendees configuration" />
</Frame>

#### Recipient Settings
- **To field**: Uses "Prompt AI" mode with: "All the emails in the calendar event marked as an attendee"
- This dynamically includes everyone who was invited to the meeting

#### Content Customization
- **Subject**: Customize the email subject line
- **Body**: Include meeting summary, action items, and the task URL for easy access to recordings

### Step 5: Slack Summary Integration

Send meeting summaries directly to your Slack for immediate visibility using the `Slack Send Direct Message` action.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/meeting-recorder-slack.png" alt="Slack integration setup" />
</Frame>


#### User Configuration
- **User field**: Switch to "Set Manually" and enter your email address connected to Slack
- **Message field**: Customize what details to include in the Slack summary

### Step 6: AI Agent for Follow-up Questions

The final step adds an AI Agent to handle follow-up questions about your meetings.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/meeting-recorder-ai-agent.png" alt="AI Agent configuration" />
</Frame>

The AI Agent uses the prompt: "Politely respond and answer questions about the meeting" which will allow for an interactive experience in task view.

This allows Lindy to:
- Respond to questions
- Provide meeting context when asked
- Help with follow-up actions
