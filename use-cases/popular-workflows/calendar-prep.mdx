## Quick Overview

Connect Lindy to your calendar and let it:

- **Trigger** 10 minutes before each meeting
- **Detect** if it's an external meeting worth researching
- **Research** attendees across LinkedIn and the web
- **Review** past email conversations and context
- **Deliver** a quick brief right before you jump on the call

You can use the [meeting prep template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=687565fdc1c16f08152a968a) to get started.

## Setting Up Your Meeting Prep Flow

### Step 1: Configure Pre-Meeting Trigger

<Frame>
 <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/calendar-prep-start.png" alt="Calendar event trigger with offset" />
</Frame>

1. Select `Google Calendar – Calendar Event Started` trigger
2. Set offset to **-10 minutes** (triggers 10 min before meeting)
3. Connect your calendar account

### Step 2: Check If External Meeting

<Frame>

</Frame>

Add a `Condition` to identify external meetings:

```
Go down this path if any attendee email domain is different from your company domain
```

This skips events like internal standups and focuses on important external calls.

### Step 3: Research the Attendee

<Frame>

</Frame>

Research your attendee using two complementary approaches:

1. **Perplexity Search** for comprehensive context:
```
Tell me about [attendee name] at [attendee company]. Include their current role, background, recent professional updates, and any recent company news.
```

2. **Search the Internet** for LinkedIn profile:
```
site:linkedin.com/in [attendee name] [attendee company]
```

This combination gives you both detailed context and their professional profile link.

### Step 4: Check Email History

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/calendar-prep-search-emails.png" alt="Email history search" />
</Frame>

Use `Gmail – Search Emails`:

Query: `from:[attendee email]` using a prompt

Limit to most recent 10 emails to get:
- Last interaction date
- Recent topics discussed
- Any open questions or commitments

### Step 5: Send Meeting Brief via Lindy Mail

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/calendar-prep-send.png" alt="Meeting brief delivery via email" />
</Frame>

Use `Lindy Mail – Send Email` to deliver your brief:

```
Subject: Quick prep for meeting with [attendee name] in 10 min

[Attendee Name] - [Title] at [Company]

BACKGROUND:
[2-3 key points from research]

LAST INTERACTION: 
[Date and main topic from email history]

TALKING POINTS:
• [Relevant topic based on their background]
• [Follow-up from previous emails]
• [Current company initiative they might care about]

LinkedIn: [profile URL]
```

**Alternative**: Use `Slack – Send DM` if you prefer instant notifications on your phone.
