## Quick Overview

A powerful Email Responder Lindy automatically monitors your inbox, detects which messages need a reply, and drafts (or sends) personalized responses using information from your knowledge base. Say goodbye to inbox overload and hello to instant, accurate replies.

Key benefits of an Email Responder:
- **Automated filtering** – Only engages with emails that require attention
- **Knowledge-powered answers** – References your knowledge base for accurate responses
- **Time savings** – Handles repetitive questions so you can focus on critical tasks
- **Consistent tone** – Matches your writing style across every reply
- **Seamless integrations** – Can label, archive, or forward emails and update your CRM

## Setting Up Your Email Responder

Follow these steps to build an email triage workflow that responds (or drafts replies) in under five minutes.

### Step 1: Connect Your Gmail Account

Start by adding the Gmail trigger so Lindy knows when new mail arrives.

</Frame>

Click the **Gmail Email Received** trigger and connect your account.  
Optional: add trigger filters to process only certain senders, labels, or keywords.

### Step 2: Decide If the Email Needs a Response

Add a **Condition** step called `Requires response?` with the prompt:

```text
Go down this path if the emailer is asking a question about my service, product, or company.
```

Emails that don’t match stop here, keeping your workflow laser-focused.

### Step 3: Search Your Knowledge Base

Add a **Knowledge Base Search** action so Lindy can look up the right answer.

</Frame>

Populate the knowledge base with FAQs, product docs, and policy pages to give Lindy plenty of material.

### Step 4: Confirm an Answer Was Found

Insert another **Condition** step named `Found response?` with the prompt:

```text
Go down this path if the previous step returned relevant knowledge.
```

This prevents Lindy from guessing when no information is available.

### Step 5: Draft (or Send) the Reply

Add the **Gmail Send Reply** action.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Configuring Gmail reply" />
</Frame>

Key options:
- Toggle **Save as Draft** to review emails before they’re sent.
- Toggle **Ask for Confirmation** if you want final approval each time.
- In the **Body** field, set the tone & style, for example:

```text
Respond in a friendly yet professional voice.  
Reference any knowledge found.  
Keep the email under 200 words.
```

## Testing Your Email Responder

</Frame>

1. Click **Save** then **Test** in the Flow Editor.  
2. Select the **Gmail Email Received** step and choose a sample email.  
3. Watch how the Conditions route the email and how the draft reply is generated.  
4. Iterate on the body prompt until you’re satisfied.

> **Tip**: Keep **Save as Draft** enabled during testing to avoid real sends.

## Advanced Features

### Smart Labeling & Routing

Use additional **Condition** branches to:
- Apply Gmail labels like `High Priority` or `Needs Review`.
- Forward VIP emails to Slack.
- Escalate billing issues to the finance team.

### CRM & Research Actions

Connect actions to:
- Create or update contacts/leads in HubSpot or Salesforce.
- Pull People Data Labs info about the sender.

### Lead Qualification & Scheduling

Combine your Email Responder with calendar actions to automatically propose meeting times for qualified leads.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep the Knowledge Base Fresh">
    Update FAQs and docs regularly so Lindy always has the latest answers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Write Precise Prompts">
    Be explicit about tone, length, and format. Short prompts like "reply politely" lead to generic emails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Draft Mode First">
    Review a few dozen replies before letting Lindy send autonomously.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fail-Safe Path">
    Add a catch-all branch that forwards emails to you if no answer is found.
