## Quick Overview

Connect Lindy to Gmail or Outlook and let it:

- **Filter** incoming mail by sender, keywords, or labels  
- **Categorize** messages (Marketing, Support, Colleagues, Spam, etc.)  
- **Label** & tidy the inbox automatically  
- **Draft** or send replies with your voice and brand tone  
- **Tap** a Knowledge Base for accurate answers when needed  

You'll find the **Email Assistant** template in your Lindy dashboard to kick-start the flow.

## Setting Up Your Email Assistant

### Step 1: Connect Your Mailbox

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Connect Gmail or Outlook" />
</Frame>

1. Select `Gmail / Outlook ‚Äì Email Received` as the trigger.  
2. Complete OAuth to grant read/send access.  
3. Pick the folders you want Lindy to watch (e.g., Inbox only).

### Step 2: Set Inbox Filters

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Trigger filters for email" />
</Frame>

Use `Trigger Filters` to keep processing costs tight:

- *Subject* contains "Invoice"  
- *From* equals `news@` (route newsletters)  
- Attachment present (flag items needing review)

### Step 3: Categorize with Conditions

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Condition for email categories" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition` node titled *Assign category* with the prompt:

```
Return marketing, support, coworker, spam, or unknown.
```

Feel free to add or rename categories to match your business.

### Step 4: Label & Organize

<Frame>

</Frame>

For each category, drop in a `Gmail ‚Äì Modify Message` action:

| Category  | Label           | Extra               |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| marketing | `Marketing üì£`  | Mark as *Read*      |
| support   | `Support üõ†`    | Mark as *Important* |
| coworker  | `Team üí¨`       | Leave unread        |
| spam      | `Spam ‚ùå`       | Move to Archive     |

### Step 5: Draft or Send Replies

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Reply action" />
</Frame>

**Action**: `Gmail ‚Äì Send Reply` (attach to categories that need a response).  

Use this prompt in the Body field:

```
Reply in a friendly, concise tone.
Pull facts from {{knowledge_base_result}} if available.
Sign off as "{{Your Name}}".
```

Toggle `Save as Draft` if you want to review before sending.

### Step 6: Add a Knowledge Base (Optional)

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Knowledge Base search" />
</Frame>

1. Attach docs (FAQ, help center, pricing guides).  
2. Insert `Search Knowledge Base` before the reply action.  
3. Gate replies with a `Found answer?` condition to avoid guesswork.

## What's Next?

After the core six-step flow works, you can chain on extras:

- Slack DM for VIP senders  
- CRM update when an email matches an open opportunity  
- Scheduler to batch-process low-priority folders overnight
