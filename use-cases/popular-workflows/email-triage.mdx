## Quick Overview

Connect your agent to Gmail or Outlook and let it:

- **Filter** incoming mail by sender, keywords, or labels  
- **Categorize** messages (Marketing, Support, Colleagues, Spam, etc.)  
- **Label** & tidy the inbox automatically  
- **Draft** or send replies with your voice and brand tone  
- **Tap** a Knowledge Base for accurate answers when needed  

You can build off of both the [email triage template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home?templateId=6684857db1aa4ed9d5baa9e3) and [email responder template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home?templateId=681f0d58c7832f340735ba2d).

## Setting Up Your Email Assistant

### Step 1: Connect Your Mailbox

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-auth.png" alt="Connect Gmail or Outlook" />
</Frame>

1. Select `Gmail / Outlook ‚Äì Email Received` as the trigger.  
2. Complete authentication to grant read/send access. 

### Step 2: Set Inbox Filters

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-trigger.png" alt="Trigger filters for email" />
</Frame>

Use `Trigger Filters` to keep processing costs tight. Examples:

- *Subject* contains "Invoice"  
- *From* equals `news@` (route newsletters)  
- Attachment present (flag items needing review)

## Step 3: Categorize with Conditions

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-conditions.png" alt="Condition for email categories" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition` step to branch emails into different paths based on their content.

Click `Add Condition` to create branches for each email type. Here are some examples:

| Condition Type | Example Setup |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Team** | Prompt: "Is from a coworker (from address contains @lindy.ai)" |
| **Support** | Prompt: "Is this a support request?" |
| **Marketing** | Prompt: "Is this marketing related?" |
| **Spam** | Prompt: "Is likely spam and does not need response" |
| **Unknown** | Prompt: "None of the above applies" |

You can add as many conditions as needed ‚Äì each one creates a separate branch in your workflow. Feel free to customize these categories to match your business needs and email patterns.

### Step 4: Label & Organize

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-label.png" alt="Apply labels" />
</Frame>

For each category, drop in a `Add Label to Email` action:

| Category  | Label           |
|-----------|-----------------|
| marketing | `Marketing üì£`  |
| support   | `Support üõ†`    |
| coworker  | `Team üí¨`       |
| spam      | `Spam ‚ùå`       |

### Step 5: Draft or Send Replies

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-body.png" alt="Reply action" />
</Frame>

For each path you want a response, connect them to a `Send Reply` action. 

Use a prompt like this in the `Body` field and adjust the adjectives to match your style:

```
Reply to this email. 

My style is : [ADJ1], [ADJ2], [ADJ3] 

Always sign off like this: [insert signature]

Be concise and actionable.
```

You can also use the signature field and add in your custom html signature. 

Toggle `Save as Draft` if you want to review before sending.

### Step 6: Add a Knowledge Base (Optional)

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/email-triage-KB.png" alt="Knowledge Base search" />
</Frame>

1. Attach docs (FAQ, help center, pricing guides).  
2. Insert `Search Knowledge Base` before the reply action.  
3. Gate replies with a `Found answer?` condition to avoid guesswork.
