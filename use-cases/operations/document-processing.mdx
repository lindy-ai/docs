## Quick Overview

Set up a central document processing hub that:

- **Receives** documents via a dedicated email inbox
- **Identifies** document types automatically (invoices, contracts, forms, etc.)
- **Extracts** key information based on document type
- **Logs** data to organized spreadsheets for easy access
- **Notifies** relevant teams when action is needed

Build it once and process hundreds of documents daily without manual data entry.

## Setting Up Your Document Hub

### Step 1: Create Your Document Inbox

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Gmail setup for document processing" />
</Frame>

1. Set up a dedicated Gmail account (e.g., docs@yourcompany.com)
2. Configure `Gmail – Email Received` as your trigger
3. Add filter: "Has attachment" = Yes
4. Share this email with teams who need document processing

### Step 2: Identify Document Type

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI document classification" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent – Analyze Document` with prompt:

```
Analyze the attached document and classify it as one of:
- INVOICE: Bills, invoices, payment requests
- CONTRACT: Agreements, contracts, legal documents
- RECEIPT: Expense receipts, purchase confirmations
- FORM: Application forms, request forms, surveys
- REPORT: Financial reports, analytics, statements
- OTHER: Anything else

Also note the vendor/party name and document date if visible.
Return as: {"type": "XXX", "party": "name", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"}
```

### Step 3: Extract Document Text

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Text extraction from documents" />
</Frame>

- Action: `File – Extract Text`
- Input: Email attachment
- This handles PDFs, Word docs, images with OCR
- Store output as document_text for next steps

### Step 4: Extract Type-Specific Data

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Custom data extraction per document type" />
</Frame>

Add `Condition` based on document type, then extract relevant data:

**For INVOICE:**
```
Extract: vendor_name, invoice_number, total_amount, due_date, 
line_items[], payment_terms, PO_number
```

**For CONTRACT:**
```
Extract: party_names[], contract_value, start_date, end_date,
renewal_terms, key_obligations[], termination_clause
```

**For RECEIPT:**
```
Extract: merchant, amount, date, category, payment_method,
expense_type, project_code
```

**For FORM:**
```
Extract all field names and their values as key-value pairs
```

### Step 5: Log to Appropriate Spreadsheet

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Spreadsheet organization by document type" />
</Frame>

Create separate Google Sheets for each document type:

1. **Invoices Sheet**
   - Columns: Date Received, Vendor, Invoice #, Amount, Due Date, Status, Link to Original

2. **Contracts Sheet**
   - Columns: Date Received, Parties, Value, Start, End, Renewal Date, Key Terms, Link

3. **Receipts Sheet**
   - Columns: Date, Merchant, Amount, Category, Employee, Approved, Link

4. **Forms Sheet**
   - Columns: Date, Form Type, Submitter, Key Fields (JSON), Status, Link

Use `Google Sheets – Append Row` for each type.

### Step 6: Smart Notifications

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Notification routing based on document content" />
</Frame>

Add conditional notifications based on document characteristics:

- **High-value invoices** (>$5,000) → Slack DM to Finance Manager
- **Contract renewals** (within 60 days) → Email to Legal Team  
- **Urgent forms** (containing "urgent" or "ASAP") → Slack to Ops Team
- **Weekly summary** → Email digest of all processed documents

### Step 7: File Organization

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Automated filing system" />
</Frame>

- Create organized Google Drive folders by type and date
- Save original document with smart naming: `[TYPE]_[PARTY]_[DATE]_[ID]`
- Add document URL to spreadsheet entries
- Maintain searchable archive
