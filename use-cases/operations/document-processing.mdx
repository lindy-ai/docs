## Quick Overview

Set up a central document processing hub that:

- **Receives** documents via a dedicated email inbox
- **Identifies** document types automatically (invoices, contracts, forms, etc.)
- **Extracts** key information based on document type
- **Logs** data to organized spreadsheets for easy access
- **Notifies** relevant teams when action is needed

Build it once and process hundreds of documents daily without manual data entry.

## Setting Up Your Document Hub

### Step 1: Create Your Document Inbox

Set up a dedicated email address to serve as the central entry point for all documents requiring processing.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/doc-processor-trigger.png" alt="Gmail setup for document processing" />
</Frame>

1. Set up a dedicated Gmail account (e.g., docs@yourcompany.com)
2. Configure `Gmail – Email Received` as your trigger
3. Add filter: "Has attachment" = Yes
4. Share this email with teams who need document processing

### Step 2: Identify Document Type

Automatically classify incoming documents to determine the appropriate processing workflow for each type.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/doc-processor-classify.png" alt="AI document classification" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent` with prompt:

```
Analyze the attached document and classify it into exactly ONE of these categories:

**INVOICE** - Documents requesting payment:
- Bills, invoices, statements
- Payment requests, purchase orders
- Proforma invoices, quotes with payment terms

**CONTRACT** - Documents establishing agreements:
- Contracts, agreements, terms of service
- NDAs, MOUs, LOIs
- Legal binding documents, amendments

**RECEIPT** - Documents confirming completed transactions:
- Purchase receipts, sales receipts
- Payment confirmations, transaction records
- Proof of purchase, order confirmations

**OTHER** - Any document that doesn't fit the above categories

Extract the following information if clearly visible:
- Vendor/Party Name: The primary company or person named
- Document Date: The main date on the document

Return your classification in this exact JSON format and nothing else:
{"type": "[INVOICE/CONTRACT/RECEIPT/OTHER]", "party": "[name or null]", "date": "[YYYY-MM-DD or null]"}

Complete the classification immediately upon document review. Do not provide explanations or additional analysis.
```

### Step 3: Route to Correct Document Processing

Use conditional routing based on the document classification to send each document type down the appropriate processing path.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/doc-processor-conditions.png" alt="Conditional routing based on document type" />
</Frame>

Add `Condition` nodes to route based on document type:
- **If type = "INVOICE"** → Invoice processing branch
- **If type = "CONTRACT"** → Contract processing branch  
- **If type = "RECEIPT"** → Receipt processing branch
- **If type = "OTHER"** → General document processing branch

This ensures each document gets the specialized treatment it needs.

### Step 4: Extract Specific Type Data for Those Categories

Pull out the relevant information fields based on the document type with specialized AI agents for each category.

<Tip>
Edit the prompts and attributes to match your documents. For best results would also prompt the model to leave items not identified as "N/A" or blank.
</Tip>

**For INVOICE branch:**
```
You're a sharp-eyed accounting detective who never misses a detail. Your mission: extract every critical piece of financial data from this invoice with laser precision.

Extract: vendor_name, invoice_number, total_amount, due_date, 
line_items[], payment_terms, PO_number, tax_amount, billing_address
```

**For CONTRACT branch:**
```
You're a meticulous legal analyst with an eye for binding commitments. Your job: identify all the key terms that matter for contract management and compliance tracking.

Extract: party_names[], contract_value, start_date, end_date,
renewal_terms, key_obligations[], termination_clause, governing_law, signatures_required
```

**For RECEIPT branch:**
```
You're a savvy expense tracker who knows every receipt tells a story. Your task: capture all the details needed for perfect expense reporting and reimbursement.

Extract: merchant, amount, date, category, payment_method,
expense_type, project_code, tax_amount, receipt_number
```

**For OTHER branch:**
```
You're a versatile document wizard who adapts to any format. Your mission: intelligently extract whatever structured data exists in this document, no matter what type it is.

Extract all field names and their values as key-value pairs, focusing on dates, amounts, names, and identifiers.
```

### Step 5: Log to an Appropriate Spreadsheet

Organize extracted data into your preferred system - spreadsheets are just the starting point.

<Frame>

</Frame>

<Warning>
Make sure the fields you are logging match the attributes extracted in the previous step.
</Warning>

**Basic Option:** Use `Google Sheets – Append Row` to log data by document type.

**Advanced Integrations:** You can post this information anywhere using:
- `HTTP Request` actions to send data to your ERP, CRM, or custom databases
- Direct integrations with Airtable, Notion, or other platforms
- Webhook endpoints for real-time processing
- API calls to accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero

Spreadsheets are just a foundation - the real power comes from connecting to your existing systems.
