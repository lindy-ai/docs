## Quick Overview

Stop losing customer context in scattered communications. Lindy will:

- **Capture** every customer interaction from email, calendar, and Slack
- **Enrich** contact data with missing information automatically
- **Update** your CRM in real-time with zero manual entry
- **Clean** duplicate records and standardize data formats

## Setting Up CRM Automation

### Step 1: Connect Your Communication Channels

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Multi-channel trigger setup" />
</Frame>

Set up multiple triggers to capture all customer touchpoints:

1. **Email**: `Gmail/Outlook – Email Received` and `Email Sent`
2. **Calendar**: `Google Calendar – Event Ended`
3. **Slack**: `Slack – Message Posted` (in customer channels)
4. **Forms**: `Webhook` for website forms or surveys

Filter emails to exclude internal/marketing messages.

### Step 2: Identify the Customer

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Customer identification logic" />
</Frame>

Extract customer information and search your CRM:

For HubSpot:
- Use `HTTP Request – GET` to `/crm/v3/objects/contacts/search`
- Search by email domain for company: `/crm/v3/objects/companies/search`

For other CRMs:
- Salesforce: SOQL query via API
- Pipedrive: `/persons/search` endpoint
- Custom CRM: Your search endpoint

Store contact ID and company ID for updates.

### Step 3: Extract Communication Insights

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI extraction of interaction details" />
</Frame>

Use `AI Agent – Extract Data` with this prompt:

```
From this customer communication, extract:

1. INTERACTION SUMMARY
- Main topic discussed
- Customer sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
- Any pain points mentioned
- Product interests or objections

2. ACTION ITEMS
- Follow-ups needed
- Questions to answer
- Commitments made

3. CONTACT UPDATES
- New job title from signature
- Phone number changes
- LinkedIn URL if mentioned

4. DEAL SIGNALS
- Budget mentioned
- Timeline discussed
- Decision makers revealed
- Competitor mentions

Return as structured JSON.
```

### Step 4: Enrich Missing Information

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Data enrichment workflow" />
</Frame>

For contacts with missing data:

1. **LinkedIn Search**: `Search Internet` for "site:linkedin.com [name] [company]"
2. **Company Data**: Use Clearbit/Apollo API or web search
3. **Email Validation**: Check deliverability status
4. Extract from signatures:
   - Title, phone, address
   - Social media links
   - Company website updates

### Step 5: Update CRM Records

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="CRM update configuration" />
</Frame>

**For HubSpot:**
```
HTTP Request – PATCH
URL: /crm/v3/objects/contacts/{contactId}
Body: {
  "properties": {
    "jobtitle": extracted_title,
    "phone": extracted_phone,
    "last_contacted": today,
    "hs_lead_status": updated_status
  }
}
```

**Log the interaction:**
```
HTTP Request – POST  
URL: /crm/v3/objects/notes
Body: {
  "properties": {
    "hs_note_body": interaction_summary,
    "hs_timestamp": event_time
  },
  "associations": [{
    "to": {"id": contactId},
    "types": [{"associationTypeId": 202}]
  }]
}
```

### Step 6: Data Hygiene Checks

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Data quality monitoring" />
</Frame>

Run daily hygiene workflows:

1. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Search for contacts with same email domain + similar names
   - Flag for manual merge or auto-merge if identical

2. **Standardization**:
   - Company names (Inc. → Incorporated)
   - Phone formats (+1-555-1234)
   - Title consistency (VP → Vice President)

3. **Completeness Check**:
   - Flag contacts missing: email, company, title
   - Alert on deals missing next steps
   - Identify stale leads (no activity >90 days)

### Step 7: Smart Notifications

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Team notification setup" />
</Frame>

Set up intelligent alerts:

- **Hot Lead Alert**: Customer mentions timeline/budget → Slack DM to rep
- **Risk Alert**: Negative sentiment detected → Notify customer success
- **Upsell Signal**: Customer asks about additional features → Alert AE
- **Weekly Hygiene Report**: Summary of updates, duplicates, missing data

Use `Condition` steps to route based on:
- Deal size thresholds
- Customer segment
- Interaction sentiment
- Keyword mentions
