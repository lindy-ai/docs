## Setting Up Your Research Flow

### Step 1: Define Competitors & Triggers

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Competitor list setup" />
</Frame>

1. Create a Google Sheet with columns: Company, Domain, LinkedIn, Twitter, Blog URL
2. Add two triggers:
   - `Chat Message Received` to add new competitors on demand
   - `Scheduler – Weekly` → Monday 08:00 for regular research runs

### Step 2: Web Monitoring

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Web search configuration" />
</Frame>

Add a `Loop – For Each` to iterate through competitors, then:

- `Search the Internet` → "company announcement news past week"
- `Search the Internet` → "company funding product launch"
- `Web Fetch` → domain/pricing to capture current pricing
- `Web Fetch` → blog_url to check for new posts

### Step 3: Social Media Analysis

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Social media monitoring" />
</Frame>

Within the same loop:

- `Search the Internet` → "site:linkedin.com/company/company posts"
- `Search the Internet` → "twitter_handle product feature announcement"
- Look for patterns in job postings: "company hiring senior roles"

Store findings in variables for later synthesis.

### Step 4: Product & Feature Tracking

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Feature comparison matrix" />
</Frame>

- `Web Fetch` → domain/features or /products page
- `AI Agent – Extract` to pull out feature lists and capabilities
- `Google Sheets – Update Row` to maintain feature comparison matrix
- Add `Condition` to flag if competitor adds features you don't have

### Step 5: Generate Intelligence Report

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI report generation" />
</Frame>

After the loop completes:

- `AI Agent – Generate Text` with prompt:

```
Using all competitor findings from research_data:

Create an executive intelligence brief with:
1. Executive Summary (3 bullets)
2. Key Moves This Week
   - Major product/feature launches
   - Pricing or positioning changes
   - Notable hires or expansions
3. Emerging Threats (what could impact us)
4. Opportunities (gaps we could exploit)
5. Recommended Actions (3-5 specific steps)

Keep it scannable with bullet points and bold key insights.
```

### Step 6: Distribute & Archive

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Report distribution" />
</Frame>

- `Slack – Send Channel Message` to #competitive-intel with summary
- `Gmail – Send Email` full report to leadership team
- `Google Docs – Create Document` to archive the full report
- `Knowledge Base – Add Document` for future reference
- `Google Sheets – Append Row` with date, key findings, action items
