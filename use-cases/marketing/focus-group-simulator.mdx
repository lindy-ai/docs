## Quick Overview

This Marketing Focus Group flow lets Lindy:

- **Simulate** a focus group discussion with distinct personas
- **Iterate** on marketing copy based on participant feedback
- **Score** each version for excitement and confusion levels
- **Refine** automatically until all participants are satisfied
- **Deliver** the final, polished marketing message

You can use the [focus group template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=68759ad92b44a92d1fef076a) to get started.

## Setting Up Your Focus Group

### Step 1: Configure the Trigger

<Frame>

</Frame>

The workflow begins with a `Chat Message Received` trigger. This allows you to initiate the focus group by sending your initial marketing copy in the task view.

No additional configuration needed—just send your copy to get started.

### Step 2: Create Focus Group Participants

</Frame>

You'll see three `Chat Send Message` actions representing your focus group:

**1. Focus Group Manager (Johnny)**
- Role: Iterates on copy based on feedback
- Manages the refinement process
- Synthesizes participant input

**2. Participant #1 (Tinkerer Tommy)**
- Persona: 30-year-old solopreneur
- Perspective: Technical, detail-oriented
- Values: Clarity and innovation

**3. Participant #2 (Savvy Sarah)**  
- Persona: 45-year-old marketing director
- Perspective: Strategic, brand-focused
- Values: ROI and market positioning

We recommend creating personas that match your ICP!

### Step 3: Set Up Feedback Ratings

</Frame>

Each participant provides two scores per iteration:

- **Excitement Score**: How compelling is the copy? (0-10)
- **Confusion Score**: How clear is the message? (0-10)

Target: 10/10 excitement, 2/10 or less confusion from ALL participants.

### Step 4: Configure Iteration Logic

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-iterations.png" alt="Iteration conditions" />
</Frame>

Add a `Condition` step that ensures:
- Minimum 3 rounds of iteration
- Continue if less than 3 rounds completed
- Proceed to quality check after 3+ rounds

This guarantees thorough refinement while preventing endless loops.

### Step 5: Quality Check Conditions

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-alignment.png" alt="Success criteria conditions" />
</Frame>

Add another `Condition` to check if:
- ALL participants rate 10/10 excitement
- ALL participants rate 2/10 or less confusion

If criteria not met → continue iterating
If criteria met → proceed to final delivery

### Step 6: Victory Message & Final Copy

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/focus-group-final.png" alt="Final output configuration" />
</Frame>

1. `Chat Send Message` with victory confirmation:
   ```
   Victory! Explain the final positioning and summarize the whole conversation — what worked, what didn't. Be concise, no yapping.
   ```

2. `AI Agent` to deliver final copy:
   ```
   Send the user the final copy so they can copy and paste it. The user MUST receive the complete, final copy after revisions.
   ```
