## Quick Overview

Stop spending hours compiling board updates. Lindy will:

- **Search** your Google Drive for the latest board materials folder
- **Process** all financial statements, KPIs, and reports in that folder
- **Analyze** the data to surface key insights and trends
- **Generate** a comprehensive memo with executive-ready narrative
- **Deliver** the polished memo directly to your inbox

Turn a day-long task into a 5-minute request.

## Setting Up Your Memo Generator

### Step 1: Configure the Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Chat message trigger setup" />
</Frame>

Start with a `Chat Message Received` trigger. This lets you request memos on-demand:

Example messages:
- "Generate board memo for January 2025"
- "Create investor update from Q4 materials"
- "Summarize financial performance YTD"

### Step 2: Search for Board Materials

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Google Drive search configuration" />
</Frame>

Add `Google Drive – Search` action:

- Search query: Use the topic/month from the chat message
- File type: Folders only
- Look for folders like "Board Materials Jan 2025" or "Investor Updates Q4"

This ensures you're always working with the latest materials.

### Step 3: List All Files in Folder

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="List files in board folder" />
</Frame>

Add `Google Drive – List Files`:

- Folder: Use the folder found in Step 2
- Include: All file types (PDFs, Sheets, Docs, Slides)
- This captures financials, KPI dashboards, strategy docs, meeting notes

### Step 4: Process All Documents

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Loop through files for processing" />
</Frame>

Create a `Loop – For Each` file:

Inside the loop:
1. `File – Extract Text` from each document
2. Build comprehensive context by combining all content
3. Preserve file names as section markers

This gives the AI complete context from all your materials.

### Step 5: Generate the Memo

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI memo generation configuration" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent – Generate Text` with this prompt:

```
You are a strategic finance advisor preparing a board memo. You have been provided with all recent board materials including financial statements, KPI dashboards, strategic updates, and meeting notes.

Generate a comprehensive board memo with these sections:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- 3 most important points for the board
- Overall health of the business in one sentence

2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
- Revenue vs. plan (% variance and why)
- Burn rate and runway analysis
- Key P&L highlights and concerns
- Cash position and working capital

3. KEY METRICS & TRENDS
- Customer metrics (growth, churn, NPS)
- Product/operational KPIs
- Team/headcount updates
- Highlight improving vs. deteriorating metrics

4. STRATEGIC PROGRESS
- Status of board-approved initiatives
- Major wins since last update
- Delays or pivots to flag

5. RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES
- Top 3 risks to the business
- Mitigation strategies in progress
- Emerging opportunities to capture

6. BOARD ACTIONS REQUESTED
- Specific decisions needed
- Information requests
- Strategic guidance sought

Write in clear, executive language. Use specific numbers. Focus on insights and implications, not just reporting data. If performance is below plan, explain why and what's being done.
```

### Step 6: Deliver the Memo

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Email delivery configuration" />
</Frame>

Use `Gmail – Send Email`:

- To: Your email (or specified board prep distribution list)
- Subject: "Board Memo - [Month] - Generated [Date]"
- Body: The complete memo from Step 5
- Optional: CC executive team for review

The memo arrives formatted and ready for review.
