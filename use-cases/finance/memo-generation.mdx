You can use the [memo generation template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=68761613a0cb797486bdf6a7) to get started.

## Quick Overview

Stop spending hours compiling board updates. Lindy will:

- **Connect** to your company data folder in Google Drive
- **Process** all PDFs and Google Sheets automatically
- **Extract** key information from financial statements, KPIs, and reports
- **Generate** a comprehensive memo with executive-ready narrative
- **Deliver** the polished memo to chat and email
- **Attach** an AI agent for follow-up questions about the data

Turn a day-long task into a simple "Go" command.

## Setting Up Your Memo Generator

### Step 1: Simple Start Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-trigger.png" alt="Chat message trigger setup" />
</Frame>

Start with a `Chat Message Received` trigger for simple activation:

Example messages:
- "Go"
- "Generate memo"
- "Run board update"

Keep it simple - the agent will process all available company data automatically.

### Step 2: Connect to Company Data Folder

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-list-files.png" alt="Google Drive list files configuration" />
</Frame>

Add `Google Drive – List Files` action:

- Folder: Connect to your company's main data folder in Google Drive
- Include: All file types (we'll filter in the next step)
- This folder should contain all financial statements, reports, and company documents

<Warning>
Remember to select the folder that corresponds with the ONE company you want to generate a memo for.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Enter File Processing Loop

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-enter-loop.png" alt="Enter file processing loop" />
</Frame>

Add `Enter Loop` using the files from Step 2:

- Input: The list of files from your Google Drive folder
- This will process each file individually to extract relevant data
- We'll handle different file types in the next step

### Step 4: Determine File Type

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-conditions.png" alt="File type detection conditions" />
</Frame>

Add `Conditions` to route files based on their type. This workflow only processes PDFs and Google Sheets:

**Path 1: If PDF**
- Add `Google Drive – Download File` 
- Then `File – Read PDF` to extract all text content

**Path 2: If Google Sheet**
- Add `Google Sheets – List Worksheets`
- Enter loop for each worksheet
- Use `Google Sheets – Get All Values` for each sheet

**Path 3: If Neither**
- Go directly to `Exit Loop` (skip unsupported file types)

All three paths will converge at the loop exit.

### Step 5: Exit Loop and Add Context

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-exit-loop.png" alt="Exit file processing loop" />
</Frame>

Add `Exit Loop` action and use `Add Context` to compile all extracted data:

- Include all PDF text content and spreadsheet data
- Preserve file names and document structure
- This transfers all company data outside the loop for analysis

### Step 6: Generate the Memo

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-agent.png" alt="AI memo generation configuration" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent – Memo Generator` with this prompt:

```
You are a strategic finance advisor preparing a board memo. You have been provided with all recent board materials including financial statements, KPI dashboards, strategic updates, and meeting notes.

**Note: While you have access to Perplexity with Sonar reasoning pro for additional research if needed, all information provided in your context is the source of truth and should be prioritized for this analysis.**

Generate a comprehensive board memo with these sections:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- 3 most important points for the board
- Overall health of the business in one sentence

2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
- Revenue vs. plan (% variance and why)
- Burn rate and runway analysis
- Key P&L highlights and concerns
- Cash position and working capital

3. KEY METRICS & TRENDS
- Customer metrics (growth, churn, NPS)
- Product/operational KPIs
- Team/headcount updates
- Highlight improving vs. deteriorating metrics

4. STRATEGIC PROGRESS
- Status of board-approved initiatives
- Major wins since last update
- Delays or pivots to flag

5. RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES
- Top 3 risks to the business
- Mitigation strategies in progress
- Emerging opportunities to capture

6. BOARD ACTIONS REQUESTED
- Specific decisions needed
- Information requests
- Strategic guidance sought

Write in clear, executive language. Use specific numbers. Focus on insights and implications, not just reporting data. If performance is below plan, explain why and what's being done.
```

### Step 6: Send to Chat and Email

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-send-memo.png" alt="Memo delivery configuration" />
</Frame>

Send the memo to both chat and email:

**Send to Chat:**
- Use `Chat – Send Message` to deliver the memo in the chat interface
- Include the full memo content for immediate review

**Send via Email:**
- Use `Gmail – Send Email` with the memo content
- Subject: "Memo - [Company] [Date]"
- Body: The complete memo from the AI agent in markdown format

### Step 7: Attach AI Agent for Follow-up Questions

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/memo-answer-questions.png" alt="AI agent for follow-up questions" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent – Company Data Assistant` to enable follow-up questions in the task:

```
You are a company data analyst with access to all the financial statements, reports, and documents from this company's Google Drive folder.

CONTEXT: You have complete access to all the data that was processed for the board memo, including:
- All PDF documents (financial statements, reports, presentations)
- All Google Sheets data (KPIs, metrics, financial models)
- The generated board memo

CAPABILITIES:
- Answer detailed questions about financial performance
- Explain specific metrics or trends
- Compare data across different time periods
- Provide context on any numbers or findings
- Clarify assumptions in financial models

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Reference specific documents when answering questions
- Provide exact numbers and calculations when possible
- If asked about data not in the processed documents, clearly state that
- Be precise and analytical in your responses

You can now answer any follow-up questions about the company's data and performance.
```
