## Quick Overview

Turn your invoice processing from hours to minutes. Lindy will:

- **Receive** invoices sent to a dedicated email address
- **Extract** vendor details, amounts, line items, and due dates
- **Validate** against PO numbers and vendor database
- **Route** for approval based on amount thresholds
- **Track** payment status and send reminders

No more manual data entry or lost invoices in email threads.

## Setting Up Invoice Automation

### Step 1: Create Your AP Inbox

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Dedicated AP email setup" />
</Frame>

1. Set up a dedicated email: invoices@yourcompany.com
2. Configure `Gmail – Email Received` trigger
3. Add filter: "Has attachment" = Yes
4. Share this email with all vendors and internal teams

<Tip>
Add this email to your vendor portal profiles and email signatures: "Send all invoices to: invoices@yourcompany.com"
</Tip>

### Step 2: Extract Invoice Data

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI invoice data extraction" />
</Frame>

Add `AI Agent – Extract Invoice Data` with prompt:

```
Extract the following from the attached invoice:
- vendor_name
- vendor_email
- invoice_number
- invoice_date
- due_date
- total_amount
- tax_amount
- subtotal
- payment_terms (e.g., Net 30)
- po_number (if present)
- line_items: [{description, quantity, unit_price, amount}]
- bank_details

Return as structured JSON. If any field is not found, mark as null.
```

### Step 3: Validate Invoice Information

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Invoice validation checks" />
</Frame>

Add validation conditions to check:

1. **Vendor Verification**
   - Check vendor name against approved vendor list in Google Sheets
   - Flag new or unrecognized vendors for review

2. **PO Matching** (if PO number exists)
   - Look up PO in your tracking sheet
   - Verify amount is within 10% of PO value
   - Check if PO has remaining budget

3. **Duplicate Check**
   - Search existing invoices for same invoice number + vendor
   - Prevent double payments

### Step 4: Calculate Approval Routing

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Approval routing logic" />
</Frame>

Set up approval tiers with `Conditions`:

| Amount | Approval Required | Action |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| < $1,000 | Auto-approve | Log and process |
| $1,000 - $5,000 | Manager | Email manager with summary |
| $5,000 - $25,000 | Director | Email director + Slack alert |
| > $25,000 | CFO | Email CFO + urgent Slack |

### Step 5: Log to Master Invoice Tracker

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Invoice tracking spreadsheet" />
</Frame>

Create a Google Sheet with columns:
- Date Received
- Vendor Name
- Invoice Number
- Amount
- Due Date
- PO Number
- Approval Status
- Approver
- Payment Status
- GL Coding
- Notes
- Invoice Link (Google Drive)

Use `Google Sheets – Append Row` to add each invoice.

### Step 6: Request Approval

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Approval request email" />
</Frame>

For invoices requiring approval, use `Gmail – Send Email`:

**Subject**: Invoice Approval Needed: [Vendor] - $[Amount]

**Body**:
```
Hi [Approver Name],

New invoice requires your approval:

Vendor: [Vendor Name]
Invoice #: [Invoice Number]
Amount: $[Total Amount]
Due Date: [Due Date]
PO Number: [PO Number]

Line Items:
[Formatted line items list]

✅ APPROVE: Reply with "Approved"
❌ REJECT: Reply with "Rejected" and reason
❓ QUESTION: Reply with your questions

View invoice: [Google Drive Link]
View in tracker: [Sheet Link]

This invoice is due in [X] days.
```

### Step 7: Process Approval Responses

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Approval response handling" />
</Frame>

Set up a separate flow triggered by email replies:

1. Check if reply contains "Approved" → Update sheet status
2. Check if reply contains "Rejected" → Flag and notify vendor
3. If questions → Create task for AP team
4. Send confirmation to approver

### Step 8: Payment Reminders

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Payment reminder system" />
</Frame>

Daily scheduled check:
- Query sheet for approved invoices due within 5 days
- Send consolidated reminder to AP team
- Flag any overdue invoices in red
- Weekly aging report to CFO
