## Quick Overview

With the Smart Support flow, your agent will:

- **Monitor** a support inbox (Gmail, Outlook—or swap in Help Desk APIs)  
- **Detect** whether the message needs a knowledge-base reply or human help  
- **Search** your docs, FAQs, and policies for accurate answers  
- **Respond** in your brand voice or draft a reply for approval  
- **Log** tickets and escalations to Slack, Zendesk, or HubSpot  
Start from the [email responder template](https://chat.lindy.ai/marketplace/?templateId=66bfc603ea73bec3fea906db) and tweak as below.


## Setting Up Your Smart Support Agent

### Step 1: Connect the Trigger to Support Inbox

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-trigger.png" alt="Gmail trigger" />
</Frame>

Select `Gmail – Email Received` (could swap for other systems like `Zendesk – New Ticket`).  

### Step 2: Determine If a Reply Is Needed

Filter out non-support emails early to avoid responding to newsletters, confirmations, or internal messages.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-trigger.png" alt="Requires reply condition" />
</Frame>

`Condition` prompt:

```
Only continue if the sender asks a question about products, orders, or policies.
```

### Step 3: Search the Knowledge Base

Query your documentation to find relevant answers before crafting a response.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-KB.png" alt="Knowledge base search" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Search Knowledge Base`  
- Attach FAQs, policies, refund rules, troubleshooting docs, and more

### Step 4: Verify an Answer Exists

Check if we have sufficient information to provide a helpful response, escalating complex issues to humans.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-verify.png" alt="Found answer condition" />
</Frame>

- If answer found → continue.  
- If not found → `Slack – Send Channel Message` the thread for human intervention
    - For `Send Channel Message` to work correctly, remember to add the Lindy app to your channel

### Step 5: Draft or Send the Reply

Provide a helpful response using knowledge base information in your brand voice.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-reply.png" alt="Send reply" />
</Frame>

Body prompt:

```
You are a professional customer support agent responding to a customer inquiry.

Using the knowledge base information provided, craft a concise, helpful response that:
- Directly answers their question using KB content
- Maintains a friendly, professional tone
- Provides clear next steps when applicable
- Stays under 100 words
- Includes relevant links or resources from the KB

If multiple solutions exist, offer the most appropriate one based on their specific situation.

Sign off professionally with your name/team.
```

### Step 6: Log Support Interactions

Track all support interactions in a Google Sheet for reporting and analysis, with optional integration to your existing ticketing system instead.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/support-agent-log.png" alt="Ticket update" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Google Sheets – Append Row` to log ticket details, response time, and resolution
- Update your support management system if applicable
