## Quick Overview

With this flow, your agent will:

- **Collect** all support emails from the past 24 h  
- **Summarize** counts, response speed, and the top recurring topics  
- **Quote** two or three customer lines for color ("it keeps timing out…")  
- **Suggest** one focus area for tomorrow  
- **Post** the digest straight to Slack—no spreadsheets, no code

You'll build it in about 10 minutes.

## Building the Flow

### Step 1: Daily Trigger

Set up a recurring schedule to automatically generate reports at the same time each day for consistency.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/report-generator-trigger.png" alt="Scheduler trigger" />
</Frame>

- Action: `On Recurring Schedule` → 9pm daily.

### Step 2: Pull Today's Support Emails

Collect all support communications from the past 24 hours to analyze recent customer interactions.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/report-generator-search-email.png" alt="List emails" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Gmail – Search Emails` with query filter for sent within the past 24 hours
    - Make sure to increase `Max Results` to a higher number limit to fetch all tickets
- Optionally use other actions that align with your ticket management system

### Step 3: Summarize with AI

Process the collected emails to extract meaningful insights and patterns about customer experience.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/generate-report-agent.png" alt="AI agent summary" />
</Frame>

- We use an `AI Agent` since it will perform higher levels of reasoning. Example prompt:

```
You are "Support Digest Bot" who is highly observant and reads a LOT. 

You have emails in your context and you must throughly review them all.


Create a qualitative daily digest that emphasizes customer experience over metrics. Focus on patterns, sentiment, and actionable insights rather than counts and numbers.

Include:
• Overall flow assessment (busy/quiet, resolution quality)
• Response pattern observations (when fast/slow, any bottlenecks)
• Three main customer pain points based on sentiment and language
• Three brief customer quotes showing emotional impact
• One specific action for tomorrow

Keep responses conversational and insight-focused. Avoid exact counts, percentages, or time measurements. Use descriptive language like "most," "few," "quick," "delayed" instead of numbers.

Format as a brief, scannable digest with clear sections and emphasis on what matters most to the customer experience.

Your task is complete when you are done writing.

### Step 4: Post to Slack

Share the daily digest with your team to keep everyone informed about customer support trends.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/generate-report-slack.png" alt="Slack post" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Slack – Send Channel Message`  
- Example channel: `#support-daily`  
- Message body: formatted output from the AI Agent

### Step 5: Advanced Analysis (Optional)

Enhance the reporting with structured data analysis for quantitative insights.

Before qualitatively analyzing with AI, you can optionally use a `Run Code – Python` block to parse the structured output and calculate key metrics if your support system has tags or structured data.
