## Quick Overview

With this flow, Lindy will:

- **Collect** all support tickets or emails from the past 24 h  
- **Summarize** counts, response speed, and the top recurring topics  
- **Quote** two or three customer lines for color ("it keeps timing outâ€¦")  
- **Suggest** one focus area for tomorrow  
- **Post** the digest straight to Slackâ€”no spreadsheets, no code

You'll build it in about 10 minutes.

## Building the Flow

### Step 1: Daily Trigger

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Scheduler trigger" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Scheduler â€“ Daily` â†’ 18:00 local.

### Step 2: Pull Today's Tickets

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="List tickets" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Zendesk â€“ List Tickets` with filter `created >= today at 00:00`.  
- Swap for Intercom / Help Scout equivalent if needed.

### Step 3: Summarize with AI

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="AI agent summary" />
</Frame>

- Action: `AI Agent â€“ Generate Text`  
- Prompt:

```
You are "Support Digest Bot".
You have JSON array {{tickets}}.
â€¢ Count total tickets, how many solved, how many still open.
â€¢ Estimate median first-reply time in minutes.
â€¢ Extract the three most common words or short phrases from subjects or tags (ignore stop words).
â€¢ Pull up to three customer quotes illustrating those themes (one line each, anonymize names).
â€¢ Suggest one focus area for tomorrow in â‰¤12 words.
Format exactly:
ðŸ“Š *Daily Support Digest* (Jun 11)
â€¢ Tickets: 38 total | 29 solved | 9 open
â€¢ Median first-reply: 27 min
â€¢ Top issues: login timeout, billing address error, mobile UI glitch

"Keeps logging me out after 5 min."
"Card charged twice on renewal."
"Menu overlaps on iPhone 13."

*Focus tomorrow â†’ fix login timeout*
```

### Step 4: Post to Slack

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Slack post" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Slack â€“ Send Channel Message`  
- Channel: `#support-daily`  
- Message body: output from the AI Agent.

<Tip>
Need more granular metrics? Insert an optional **Run Code â€“ Python** step before the AI Agent to pre-calculate numbers (e.g., exact medians, tag frequencies, SLA breaches) and pass them into the prompt for richer reporting.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tag Consistently">
    Clean tagging = better top-issue detection; revisit macros monthly.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep It Brief">
    Aim for one Slack post; link back to tickets for deep dives.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escalate Urgent Themes">
    Add a Condition to DM engineers if any quote contains "crash" or "outage."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Iterate on Tone">
    Skim the first few digests and tweak wording to match team culture.
  </Accordion>
