## Quick Overview

This inbound flow lets Lindy:

- **Answer** calls on a dedicated number  
- **Gather** the caller's name and question in natural conversation  
- **Access** pre-loaded context for fast, accurate responses  
- **Respond** concisely and close the loop  
- **Record** summaries to Sheets and alert your team in Slack  

Start from the [inbound support template](https://chat.lindy.ai/home/?templateId=6875ad458aeebd9c66a8b3b5) and customize.

## Setting Up Your Inbound Call Bot

### Step 1: Provision a Number

<Frame>

</Frame>

1. Click the `Call Received` trigger.  
2. Purchase or select a unique Lindy Phone number.

### Step 2: Add Context for Support Knowledge

Pre-load your support information to ensure fast response times during calls.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/voice-support-context.png" alt="Add Context action" />
</Frame>

- Action: `Add Context`
- Upload lightweight company context: FAQs, key policies, common troubleshooting steps
- Keep it concise - this context stays in memory during the entire call for optimal latency

<Tip>
We use Add Context instead of Search Knowledge Base because even though you can perform actions during phone calls, pre-loading lightweight context helps maintain fast response times.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Inbound Phone Call Agent

Configure your AI agent to handle the conversation with pre-loaded context.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/voice-support-agent.png" alt="AI Agent for calls" />
</Frame>

AI Agent prompt:

```
You are a professional customer support agent answering inbound calls.

Instructions:
- Greet callers warmly and ask for their name
- Listen to their question and provide helpful answers using the context provided
- Keep responses concise and conversational (1-2 sentences)
- End calls politely when the issue is resolved
- Always maintain a friendly, professional tone

Use the company context provided to answer questions about policies, procedures, and common issues.
```

<Tip> 
Use balanced or fast Claude models for phone calls - they perform well for real-time conversations.
</Tip> 

### Step 4: Document the Call

Track all phone interactions for quality assurance and follow-up.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/voice-support-log.png" alt="Append row and task URL" />
</Frame>

- `Get Task URL` → store reference link.  
- `Google Sheets – Append Row` with name, question, answer, outcome, URL.

### Step 5: Team Alert

Notify your team about the call for immediate follow-up if needed.

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/voice-support-alert.png" alt="Slack alert" />
</Frame>

Send a Slack message summarizing the call with the task URL.
