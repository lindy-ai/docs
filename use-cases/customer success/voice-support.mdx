## Quick Overview

This inbound flow lets Lindy:

- **Answer** calls on a dedicated number  
- **Gather** the caller's name and question in natural conversation  
- **Search** your knowledge base for accurate answers  
- **Respond** concisely and close the loop  
- **Record** summaries to Sheets and alert your team in Slack  

You'll find the **Inbound Calling** template in your Lindy dashboard to kick-start the flow.

## Setting Up Your Inbound Call Bot

</Frame>

AI Agent prompt (summary):

```
• Ask for the caller's name.
• Wait for response, then ask how you can help.
• Keep answers 1-2 sentences.
• Say goodbye and end call when finished.
```

### Step 3: Exit to Knowledge Search

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Exit condition" />
</Frame>

`Exit Condition`: caller has asked a question → proceed to KB search.

### Step 4: Search the Knowledge Base

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Knowledge search" />
</Frame>

Attach FAQs, booking policies, and troubleshooting docs. Lindy will re-query for each new question.

### Step 5: Document the Call

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Append row and task URL" />
</Frame>

- `Get Task URL` → store reference link.  
- `Google Sheets – Append Row` with name, question, answer, outcome, URL.

### Step 6: Team Alert

<Frame>
  <img src="/lindy-brand-assets/placeholder.png" alt="Slack alert" />
</Frame>

Send a Slack message summarizing the call with the task URL.
